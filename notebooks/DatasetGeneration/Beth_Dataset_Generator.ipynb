      "  \"The holiday season is upon us and there are many dangers you need to protect your pet from.   Never feed your pet human food.   Candy and sweets are very rich and are likely to cause vomiting and diarrhea.   Chocolate can be toxic.  High fat foods can trigger very serious episodes of pancreatitis and vomiting.  Specific foods, such as grapes and raisins, can be highly toxic.    Bones of any kind can cause obstructions in the stomach and intestines, and even worse may cause a puncture leading to life-threatening peritonitis.   Decorations used during the holidays can also be dangerous to your pet.  Many plants, such as poinsettias and mistletoe, are toxic.   Electric lights and display have power cords that can be chewed on and cause electric shocks, burns, and electrocution.  String-like decorations such as tinsel, can lead to intestinal obstructions by acting as linear foreign bodies, especially in cats.  And of course you need to make sure your pet is not exposed to unsafe conditions outside, such as extreme cold, ice, snow, and salt.   If you have any questions about keeping your pet safe, please feel free to ask.\",\n",

      "  \"Recent television ad campaigns are promoting Cologuard\\u00a9 as an alternative to colonoscopy.  As Gastroenterologists, we strongly recommend a colonoscopy which has proven to be the gold standard for screening. Not only does a colonoscopy allow us to view the entire length of the colon, but it is the only method that can both detect colon cancer and prevent it by allowing us to remove precancerous polyps.  Patients are given a false sense of well-being when another test is negative, yet they could have multiple polyps.  Generally, screening colonoscopy is a 100% covered benefit with no out-of-pocket expense to the patient. If a patient chooses an alternative test to colonoscopy and the alternative test is positive, the patient will then need to schedule a colonoscopy to follow-up.  Because the previous test is positive, the colonoscopy is considered diagnostic and subject to deductibles and co-pays.  The alternate tests typically fully utilize the screening benefits under most policies.  Please notify our staff if you have utilized any alternative screening method when making an appointment so that we can best assist you with determining the benefits available to you under your insurance policy.\",\n",
