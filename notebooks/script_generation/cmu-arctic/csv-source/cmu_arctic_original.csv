0	CMU	Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
1	CMU	Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
2	CMU	For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
3	CMU	Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
4	CMU	Will we ever forget it.
5	CMU	God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
6	CMU	And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
7	CMU	Gad, your letter came just in time.
8	CMU	He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
9	CMU	I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
10	CMU	If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
11	CMU	Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
12	CMU	He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
13	CMU	Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
14	CMU	It's the aurora borealis.
15	CMU	There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
16	CMU	From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
17	CMU	There was a change now.
18	CMU	I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
19	CMU	Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
20	CMU	It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
21	CMU	Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
22	CMU	A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
23	CMU	It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
24	CMU	I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
25	CMU	It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
26	CMU	To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
27	CMU	Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
28	CMU	Their forces were already moving into the north country.
29	CMU	I had faith in them.
30	CMU	They were three hundred yards apart.
31	CMU	Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
32	CMU	He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
33	CMU	Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
34	CMU	He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
35	CMU	She turned in at the hotel.
36	CMU	I was the only one who remained sitting.
37	CMU	We'll have to watch our chances.
38	CMU	The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
39	CMU	I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
40	CMU	Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
41	CMU	How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
42	CMU	It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
43	CMU	Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
44	CMU	He moved away as quietly as he had come.
45	CMU	The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
46	CMU	Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
47	CMU	He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
48	CMU	Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
49	CMU	In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
50	CMU	The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
51	CMU	It was a curious coincidence.
52	CMU	Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
53	CMU	There was nothing on the rock.
54	CMU	Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
55	CMU	Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
56	CMU	I have no idea, replied Philip.
57	CMU	I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
58	CMU	His immaculate appearance was gone.
59	CMU	Anyway, no one saw her like that.
60	CMU	Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
61	CMU	The men stared into each other's face.
62	CMU	Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
63	CMU	The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
64	CMU	They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
65	CMU	He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
66	CMU	Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
67	CMU	In a flash Philip followed its direction.
68	CMU	It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
69	CMU	He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
70	CMU	What was the object of your little sensation.
71	CMU	But who was Eileen's double.
72	CMU	The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
73	CMU	And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
74	CMU	There has been a change, she interrupted him.
75	CMU	The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
76	CMU	It is the fire, partly, she said.
77	CMU	Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
78	CMU	It was a large canoe.
79	CMU	What if Jeanne failed him.
80	CMU	What if she did not come to the rock.
81	CMU	His face was streaming with blood.
82	CMU	A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
83	CMU	Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
84	CMU	A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
85	CMU	Death had come with terrible suddenness.
86	CMU	Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
87	CMU	He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
88	CMU	The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
89	CMU	The singing voice approached rapidly.
90	CMU	His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
91	CMU	He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
92	CMU	For a full minute he crouched and listened.
93	CMU	He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
94	CMU	A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
95	CMU	Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
96	CMU	Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
97	CMU	Shall I carry you.
98	CMU	A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
99	CMU	You must sleep, he urged.
100	CMU	You, you would not keep the truth from me.
101	CMU	He will follow us soon.
102	CMU	But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
103	CMU	She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
104	CMU	Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
105	CMU	The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
106	CMU	If you only could know how I thank you.
107	CMU	He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
108	CMU	Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
109	CMU	Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
110	CMU	Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
111	CMU	He was wounded in the arm.
112	CMU	I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
113	CMU	Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
114	CMU	He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
115	CMU	Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
116	CMU	She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
117	CMU	Pierre obeys me when we are together.
118	CMU	Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
119	CMU	My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
120	CMU	They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
121	CMU	Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
122	CMU	She had died from cold and starvation.
123	CMU	It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
124	CMU	He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
125	CMU	Each day she became a more vital part of him.
126	CMU	It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
127	CMU	This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
128	CMU	Her face was against his breast.
129	CMU	She was his now, forever.
130	CMU	Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
131	CMU	A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
132	CMU	Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
133	CMU	He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
134	CMU	I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
135	CMU	About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
136	CMU	Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
137	CMU	In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
138	CMU	He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
139	CMU	Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
140	CMU	It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
141	CMU	Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
142	CMU	Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
143	CMU	But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
144	CMU	I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
145	CMU	Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
146	CMU	A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
147	CMU	Now these things had been struck dead within him.
148	CMU	For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
149	CMU	Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
150	CMU	And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
151	CMU	Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
152	CMU	MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
153	CMU	He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
154	CMU	Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
155	CMU	A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
156	CMU	He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
157	CMU	Does that look good.
158	CMU	They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
159	CMU	You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
160	CMU	Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
161	CMU	That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
162	CMU	Philip made no effort to follow.
163	CMU	He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
164	CMU	They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
165	CMU	Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
166	CMU	I was near the cabin, and saw you.
167	CMU	Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
168	CMU	Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
169	CMU	There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
170	CMU	And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
171	CMU	Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
172	CMU	The date was nearly eighteen years old.
173	CMU	They were the presage of storm.
174	CMU	Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
175	CMU	For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
176	CMU	She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
177	CMU	Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
178	CMU	Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
179	CMU	If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
180	CMU	So cheer up, and give us your paw.
181	CMU	This time he did not yap for mercy.
182	CMU	And the air was growing chilly.
183	CMU	Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
184	CMU	The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
185	CMU	Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
186	CMU	Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
187	CMU	Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
188	CMU	The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
189	CMU	Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
190	CMU	For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
191	CMU	He did not rush in.
192	CMU	It was edged with ice.
193	CMU	He drank of the water cautiously.
194	CMU	But a strange thing happened.
195	CMU	He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
196	CMU	Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
197	CMU	Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
198	CMU	Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
199	CMU	He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
200	CMU	He cried, and swung the club wildly.
201	CMU	She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
202	CMU	They were following the shore of a lake.
203	CMU	The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
204	CMU	From now on we're pals.
205	CMU	He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
206	CMU	How much was it.
207	CMU	Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
208	CMU	It was not a large lake, and almost round.
209	CMU	Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
210	CMU	It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
211	CMU	Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
212	CMU	Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
213	CMU	Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
214	CMU	They die out of spite.
215	CMU	The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
216	CMU	Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
217	CMU	The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
218	CMU	At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
219	CMU	A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
220	CMU	I don't know why you're here at all.
221	CMU	What part of the United States is your home.
222	CMU	My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
223	CMU	She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
224	CMU	I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
225	CMU	That came before my A B C's.
226	CMU	It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
227	CMU	But it contributed to the smash.
228	CMU	The last one I knew was an overseer.
229	CMU	Do you know any good land around here.
230	CMU	The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
231	CMU	I cannot follow you, she said.
232	CMU	I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
233	CMU	Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
234	CMU	His voice was passionately rebellious.
235	CMU	Don't you see I hate you.
236	CMU	So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
237	CMU	It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
238	CMU	He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
239	CMU	Wash your hands of me.
240	CMU	I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
241	CMU	I saw it when she rolled.
242	CMU	I only read the quotations.
243	CMU	He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
244	CMU	Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
245	CMU	You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
246	CMU	They ought to pass here some time today.
247	CMU	I had been sad too long already.
248	CMU	All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
249	CMU	He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
250	CMU	I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
251	CMU	O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
252	CMU	He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
253	CMU	Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
254	CMU	You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
255	CMU	See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
256	CMU	They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
257	CMU	Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
258	CMU	Think of investing in such an adventure.
259	CMU	Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
260	CMU	I have been doubly baptized.
261	CMU	They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
262	CMU	Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
263	CMU	And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
264	CMU	The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
265	CMU	They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
266	CMU	Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
267	CMU	Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
268	CMU	That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
269	CMU	And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
270	CMU	Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
271	CMU	You can take a vacation on pay.
272	CMU	They are big trees and require plenty of room.
273	CMU	And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
274	CMU	There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
275	CMU	Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
276	CMU	McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
277	CMU	It would give me nervous prostration.
278	CMU	She said with chattering teeth.
279	CMU	I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
280	CMU	I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
281	CMU	If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
282	CMU	The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
283	CMU	There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
284	CMU	But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
285	CMU	Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
286	CMU	Keep an eye on him.
287	CMU	Those are my oysters, he said at last.
288	CMU	They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
289	CMU	One by one the boys were captured.
290	CMU	The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
291	CMU	Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
292	CMU	They were deep in the primeval forest.
293	CMU	He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
294	CMU	And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
295	CMU	Bassett was a fastidious man.
296	CMU	There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
297	CMU	This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
298	CMU	I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
299	CMU	From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
300	CMU	But all my dreams violated this law.
301	CMU	It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
302	CMU	But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
303	CMU	I graduated last of my class.
304	CMU	They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
305	CMU	He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
306	CMU	Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
307	CMU	His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
308	CMU	White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
309	CMU	Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
310	CMU	Therefore, hurrah for the game.
311	CMU	It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
312	CMU	Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
313	CMU	Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
314	CMU	Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
315	CMU	We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
316	CMU	He was a wise hyena.
317	CMU	Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
318	CMU	And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
319	CMU	With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
320	CMU	The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
321	CMU	This is a common experience with all of us.
322	CMU	He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
323	CMU	It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
324	CMU	Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
325	CMU	Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
326	CMU	They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
327	CMU	The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
328	CMU	Ah, indeed.
329	CMU	Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
330	CMU	Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
331	CMU	Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
332	CMU	This is no place for you.
333	CMU	He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
334	CMU	Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
335	CMU	So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
336	CMU	Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
337	CMU	The fighting had now become intermittent.
338	CMU	They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
339	CMU	It was like the beating of hoofs.
340	CMU	Why, doggone you all, shake again.
341	CMU	Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
342	CMU	You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
343	CMU	He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
344	CMU	She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
345	CMU	Get down and dig in.
346	CMU	They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
347	CMU	They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
348	CMU	It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
349	CMU	Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
350	CMU	It was more like sugar.
351	CMU	I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
352	CMU	Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
353	CMU	Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
354	CMU	A burst of laughter was his reward.
355	CMU	You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
356	CMU	A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
357	CMU	They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
358	CMU	Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
359	CMU	But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
360	CMU	But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
361	CMU	Nope, not the slightest idea.
362	CMU	It is not an attempt to smash the market.
363	CMU	We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
364	CMU	These rumors may even originate with us.
365	CMU	A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
366	CMU	There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
367	CMU	I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
368	CMU	In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
369	CMU	He saw all men in the business game doing this.
370	CMU	It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
371	CMU	He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
372	CMU	Points of view, new ideas, life.
373	CMU	But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
374	CMU	The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
375	CMU	Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
376	CMU	This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
377	CMU	That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
378	CMU	How old are you, daddy.
379	CMU	But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
380	CMU	My name's Ferguson.
381	CMU	Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
382	CMU	To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
383	CMU	The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
384	CMU	That's what Carnegie did.
385	CMU	I can't argue with you, and you know that.
386	CMU	Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
387	CMU	It was my idea to a tee.
388	CMU	Mab, she said.
389	CMU	I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
390	CMU	But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
391	CMU	There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
392	CMU	Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
393	CMU	It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
394	CMU	As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
395	CMU	A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
396	CMU	Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
397	CMU	In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
398	CMU	And here's another idea.
399	CMU	Manuel had one besetting sin.
400	CMU	The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
401	CMU	Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
402	CMU	His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
403	CMU	Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
404	CMU	It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
405	CMU	And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
406	CMU	Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
407	CMU	The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
408	CMU	He could feel a new stir in the land.
409	CMU	So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
410	CMU	It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
411	CMU	There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
412	CMU	But I am at the end of my resources.
413	CMU	Now our figuring was all right.
414	CMU	It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
415	CMU	The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
416	CMU	It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
417	CMU	The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
418	CMU	The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
419	CMU	When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
420	CMU	By golly, the boy wins.
421	CMU	Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
422	CMU	McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
423	CMU	Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
424	CMU	Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
425	CMU	They do not know the length of time of incubation.
426	CMU	Enters now the psychology of the situation.
427	CMU	It was not exactly a deportation.
428	CMU	Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
429	CMU	Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
430	CMU	Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
431	CMU	The boy at the wheel lost his head.
432	CMU	To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
433	CMU	A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
434	CMU	What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
435	CMU	But Martin smiled a superior smile.
436	CMU	By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
437	CMU	At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
438	CMU	At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
439	CMU	Yes, sir, I corrected.
440	CMU	Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
441	CMU	You live on an income which your father earned.
442	CMU	He was worth nothing to the world.
443	CMU	Then you don't believe in altruism.
444	CMU	The creative joy, I murmured.
445	CMU	He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
446	CMU	Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
447	CMU	I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
448	CMU	A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
449	CMU	No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
450	CMU	I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
451	CMU	Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
452	CMU	Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
453	CMU	The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
454	CMU	I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
455	CMU	But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
456	CMU	What I saw I could not at first believe.
457	CMU	The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
458	CMU	There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
459	CMU	I had forgotten their existence.
460	CMU	Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
461	CMU	But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
462	CMU	They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
463	CMU	Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
464	CMU	He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
465	CMU	Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
466	CMU	And so early in the voyage, too.
467	CMU	In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
468	CMU	The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
469	CMU	He spat it out like so much venom.
470	CMU	I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
471	CMU	He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
472	CMU	The night was calm and snowy.
473	CMU	I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
474	CMU	His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
475	CMU	At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
476	CMU	Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
477	CMU	Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
478	CMU	I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
479	CMU	Tom Spink has a harpoon.
480	CMU	Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
481	CMU	And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
482	CMU	Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
483	CMU	No-sir-ee.
484	CMU	Each insult added to the value of the claim.
485	CMU	For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
486	CMU	The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
487	CMU	Their love burned with increasing brightness.
488	CMU	They were artists, not biologists.
489	CMU	Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
490	CMU	And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
491	CMU	Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
492	CMU	The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
493	CMU	O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
494	CMU	He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
495	CMU	And Tom King patiently endured.
496	CMU	King took every advantage he knew.
497	CMU	The lines were now very taut.
498	CMU	And right there I saw and knew it all.
499	CMU	Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
500	CMU	You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
501	CMU	Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
502	CMU	His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
503	CMU	He was an athlete and a giant.
504	CMU	We fished sharks on Niihau together.
505	CMU	The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
506	CMU	In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
507	CMU	Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
508	CMU	Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
509	CMU	Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
510	CMU	There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
511	CMU	No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
512	CMU	We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
513	CMU	We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
514	CMU	But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
515	CMU	Also, there was awe in their faces.
516	CMU	Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
517	CMU	Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
518	CMU	Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
519	CMU	He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
520	CMU	Without them he could not run his empire.
521	CMU	For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
522	CMU	They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
523	CMU	At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
524	CMU	The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
525	CMU	Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
526	CMU	The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
527	CMU	Men who endure it, call it living death.
528	CMU	As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
529	CMU	Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
530	CMU	In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
531	CMU	May drought destroy your crops.
532	CMU	Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
533	CMU	But Johannes could, and did.
534	CMU	A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
535	CMU	He would destroy all things that are fixed.
536	CMU	He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
537	CMU	What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
538	CMU	I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
539	CMU	Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
540	CMU	The Warden with a quart of champagne.
541	CMU	Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
542	CMU	I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
543	CMU	He may anticipate the day of his death.
544	CMU	The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
545	CMU	I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
546	CMU	Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
547	CMU	Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
548	CMU	Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
549	CMU	This also became part of the daily schedule.
550	CMU	All an appearance can know is mirage.
551	CMU	Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
552	CMU	I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
553	CMU	Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
554	CMU	Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
555	CMU	Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
556	CMU	The last refugee had passed.
557	CMU	And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
558	CMU	Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
559	CMU	His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
560	CMU	Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.
561	CMU	What the flaming.
562	CMU	Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
563	CMU	Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.
564	CMU	With them were Indians, also three other men.
565	CMU	Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.
566	CMU	Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.
567	CMU	He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.
568	CMU	At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.
569	CMU	Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
570	CMU	He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
571	CMU	I never saw anything like her in my life.
572	CMU	There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.
573	CMU	Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying.
574	CMU	There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know.
575	CMU	And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
576	CMU	Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
577	CMU	But we'll just postpone this.
578	CMU	There was the Emma Louisa.
579	CMU	This is my fifth voyage.
580	CMU	It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
581	CMU	Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.
582	CMU	Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.
583	CMU	I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.
584	CMU	Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.
585	CMU	We don't see ourselves as foolish.
586	CMU	He had comparatively no advantages at first.
587	CMU	He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.
588	CMU	I was sick once -- typhoid.
589	CMU	In a way he is my protege.
590	CMU	We are both children together.
591	CMU	It's only his indigestion I find fault with.
592	CMU	She'd make a good wife for the cashier.
593	CMU	Gad, do I remember it.
594	CMU	You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.
595	CMU	I can see that knife now.
596	CMU	When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.
597	CMU	His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.
598	CMU	He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door.
599	CMU	Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.
600	CMU	Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
601	CMU	I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.
602	CMU	He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.
603	CMU	His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.
604	CMU	Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.
605	CMU	Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
606	CMU	Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.
607	CMU	They robbed me a few years later.
608	CMU	He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.
609	CMU	Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.
610	CMU	I was completely lost in my work.
611	CMU	His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
612	CMU	He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
613	CMU	Philip dropped back into his chair.
614	CMU	If I was out of the game it would be easily made.
615	CMU	MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.
616	CMU	It is growing, every day, every hour.
617	CMU	Now, you understand.
618	CMU	You have associated with some of these men.
619	CMU	And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
620	CMU	Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
621	CMU	All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
622	CMU	Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
623	CMU	Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
624	CMU	He caught himself with a jerk.
625	CMU	How does your wager look now.
626	CMU	He confessed that the sketch had startled him.
627	CMU	After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
628	CMU	He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.
629	CMU	Philip knew that she was not an Indian.
630	CMU	In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.
631	CMU	Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.
632	CMU	The thought set his blood tingling.
633	CMU	But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow.
634	CMU	Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.
635	CMU	It won't be for sale.
636	CMU	For a few moments he ate in silence.
637	CMU	Philip did not pursue the subject.
638	CMU	Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
639	CMU	Suppose you saw me at work through the window.
640	CMU	He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.
641	CMU	There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.
642	CMU	All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
643	CMU	The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.
644	CMU	The flush was gone from her face.
645	CMU	That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.
646	CMU	He understood the meaning of the look.
647	CMU	She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
648	CMU	I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.
649	CMU	They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
650	CMU	We must achieve our own salvation.
651	CMU	In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.
652	CMU	He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.
653	CMU	Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.
654	CMU	Now it was missing from the wall.
655	CMU	He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.
656	CMU	I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.
657	CMU	Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.
658	CMU	If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
659	CMU	Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.
660	CMU	Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
661	CMU	Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
662	CMU	There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
663	CMU	There was no answer from the other side.
664	CMU	Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
665	CMU	With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.
666	CMU	Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.
667	CMU	In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.
668	CMU	Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
669	CMU	It is the nearest refuge.
670	CMU	There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
671	CMU	The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.
672	CMU	Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
673	CMU	You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
674	CMU	He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.
675	CMU	In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
676	CMU	Your face is red with blood.
677	CMU	Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
678	CMU	He can care for himself.
679	CMU	They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.
680	CMU	Until I die, he exclaimed.
681	CMU	Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.
682	CMU	The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.
683	CMU	For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.
684	CMU	I want to die in it.
685	CMU	Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
686	CMU	And yet if she came he had no words to say.
687	CMU	He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
688	CMU	Within himself he called it no longer his own.
689	CMU	Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
690	CMU	Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
691	CMU	Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.
692	CMU	There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.
693	CMU	You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
694	CMU	I'll only be in the way.
695	CMU	He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.
696	CMU	Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.
697	CMU	I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
698	CMU	For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.
699	CMU	He was sure, now, of but few things.
700	CMU	It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.
701	CMU	Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.
702	CMU	Such men believe, when they come together.
703	CMU	The journey was continued at dawn.
704	CMU	Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.
705	CMU	There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
706	CMU	He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.
707	CMU	For two hours not a word passed between them.
708	CMU	I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.
709	CMU	That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
710	CMU	We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.
711	CMU	Billinger may arrive in time.
712	CMU	There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.
713	CMU	I want my men to work by themselves.
714	CMU	Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.
715	CMU	Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.
716	CMU	Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.
717	CMU	It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
718	CMU	Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.
719	CMU	He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.
720	CMU	Philip bent low over Pierre.
721	CMU	Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.
722	CMU	She saw the answer in his face.
723	CMU	Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.
724	CMU	There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
725	CMU	There followed a roar that shook the earth.
726	CMU	Blind with rage, he darted in.
727	CMU	In it was the joy of life.
728	CMU	Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
729	CMU	But this little defect did not worry him.
730	CMU	And then, steadily, he began to chew.
731	CMU	Together they ate the rabbit.
732	CMU	They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.
733	CMU	It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
734	CMU	Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
735	CMU	It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.
736	CMU	But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
737	CMU	Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.
738	CMU	After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.
739	CMU	Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.
740	CMU	The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.
741	CMU	Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.
742	CMU	And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
743	CMU	It was steel, a fisher trap.
744	CMU	OW, a wild dog, he growled.
745	CMU	He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
746	CMU	That is the strange part of it.
747	CMU	His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.
748	CMU	For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.
749	CMU	In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.
750	CMU	She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
751	CMU	His teeth shut with a last click.
752	CMU	It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.
753	CMU	In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.
754	CMU	He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
755	CMU	The moon had already begun its westward decline.
756	CMU	They laughed like two happy children.
757	CMU	He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
758	CMU	Fast, but endure.
759	CMU	A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
760	CMU	The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
761	CMU	He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.
762	CMU	Then he shouted, Shut up.
763	CMU	He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.
764	CMU	On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
765	CMU	To these he gave castor oil.
766	CMU	Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.
767	CMU	Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.
768	CMU	I'll see to poor Hughie.
769	CMU	Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.
770	CMU	Also, I want information.
771	CMU	Let them go out and eat with my boys.
772	CMU	I, I beg pardon, he drawled.
773	CMU	And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
774	CMU	I was in New York when the crash came.
775	CMU	No, I did not fall among thieves.
776	CMU	Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
777	CMU	Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
778	CMU	I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
779	CMU	Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.
780	CMU	He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.
781	CMU	That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.
782	CMU	Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
783	CMU	He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.
784	CMU	Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged.
785	CMU	So was Packard's finish suicide.
786	CMU	Joan cried, with shining eyes.
787	CMU	Nobody knows how the natives got them.
788	CMU	How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.
789	CMU	The planters are already considering the matter.
790	CMU	I use great trouble advisedly.
791	CMU	Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.
792	CMU	We leave the eventuality to time and law.
793	CMU	I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
794	CMU	Society is shaken to its foundations.
795	CMU	A month in Australia would finish me.
796	CMU	Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.
797	CMU	You were destroying my life.
798	CMU	Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery.
799	CMU	I'm as good as a man, she urged.
800	CMU	You read the quotations in today's paper.
801	CMU	He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them.
802	CMU	Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.
803	CMU	This is eighteen eighty.
804	CMU	Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.
805	CMU	Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.
806	CMU	Let us talk it over and find a way out.
807	CMU	It is a good property, and worth more than that.
808	CMU	I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.
809	CMU	Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.
810	CMU	The issue was not in doubt.
811	CMU	Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.
812	CMU	Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.
813	CMU	It's a Yankee, Joan cried.
814	CMU	He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.
815	CMU	They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.
816	CMU	But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.
817	CMU	The President of the United States was his friend.
818	CMU	Your face was the personification of duplicity.
819	CMU	Shorty turned to their employers.
820	CMU	You were engaged.
821	CMU	I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
822	CMU	Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
823	CMU	What's that grub-thief got to do with it.
824	CMU	It was a superb picture.
825	CMU	So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
826	CMU	And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
827	CMU	Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.
828	CMU	Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.
829	CMU	They just lay off in the bush and plugged away.
830	CMU	The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating.
831	CMU	And there was a dog that barked.
832	CMU	There are four, all low, McCoy answered.
833	CMU	The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
834	CMU	The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand.
835	CMU	They had been on the same lay as ourselves.
836	CMU	You are positively soulless, he said savagely.
837	CMU	Harrison is still my chauffeur.
838	CMU	The boy grew and prospered.
839	CMU	He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone.
840	CMU	Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol.
841	CMU	I know they are my oysters.
842	CMU	By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek.
843	CMU	They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents.
844	CMU	It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.
845	CMU	The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.
846	CMU	At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.
847	CMU	Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
848	CMU	Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.
849	CMU	Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.
850	CMU	You fired me out of your house, in short.
851	CMU	Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.
852	CMU	It's worth eight dollars.
853	CMU	And he did hurt my arm.
854	CMU	Saxon's onto her job.
855	CMU	Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.
856	CMU	But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
857	CMU	I was not to cry out in the face of fear.
858	CMU	And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
859	CMU	The boy threw back his head with pride.
860	CMU	Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.
861	CMU	Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.
862	CMU	We could throw stones with our feet.
863	CMU	It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.
864	CMU	These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter.
865	CMU	Then it was that a strange thing happened.
866	CMU	From the source of light a harsh voice said.
867	CMU	But I did not enjoy it long.
868	CMU	We were now good friends.
869	CMU	Two of the Folk were already up.
870	CMU	Now animals do not like mockery.
871	CMU	He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.
872	CMU	Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.
873	CMU	Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.
874	CMU	Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.
875	CMU	But we were without this momentum.
876	CMU	There was one difficulty, however.
877	CMU	The hyena proceeded to dine.
878	CMU	The time was considered auspicious.
879	CMU	Or have they already devised one.
880	CMU	We would not spend another such night.
881	CMU	At first his progress was slow and erratic.
882	CMU	He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated.
883	CMU	The awe of man rushed over him again.
884	CMU	The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders.
885	CMU	Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities.
886	CMU	For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched.
887	CMU	All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret.
888	CMU	At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style.
889	CMU	Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round.
890	CMU	His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck.
891	CMU	Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic.
892	CMU	Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way.
893	CMU	A flying arrow passed between us.
894	CMU	I pulled, suddenly, with all my might.
895	CMU	Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work.
896	CMU	His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children.
897	CMU	It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp.
898	CMU	Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers.
899	CMU	We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters.
900	CMU	We never made another migration.
901	CMU	Nor was Elam Harnish an exception.
902	CMU	A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor.
903	CMU	The 29th very foggy.
904	CMU	Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer.
905	CMU	The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt.
906	CMU	He had been born with this endowment.
907	CMU	And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal.
908	CMU	Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun.
909	CMU	He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury.
910	CMU	Again he had done the big thing.
911	CMU	Daylight was tired, profoundly tired.
912	CMU	The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter.
913	CMU	Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day.
914	CMU	Their supply of grub was gone.
915	CMU	Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead.
916	CMU	Not till the twentieth of May did the river break.
917	CMU	It was a gigantic inadequacy.
918	CMU	Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel.
919	CMU	He had been so easy.
920	CMU	Change chairs, Daylight commanded.
921	CMU	I'd sooner have my chips back.
922	CMU	They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire.
923	CMU	His partners had starved and died on the Stewart.
924	CMU	As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all.
925	CMU	It does, was her audacious answer.
926	CMU	Oh, it's just a novel, a love story.
927	CMU	Whoever lived on the ranch did that.
928	CMU	How old are you, mother.
929	CMU	Here he got a fresh thrill.
930	CMU	It was unobtrusive, yet it was there.
931	CMU	Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned.
932	CMU	These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him.
933	CMU	I play that choice wide open to win.
934	CMU	Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up.
935	CMU	But how are you going to do it.
936	CMU	Lots of men take women buggy riding.
937	CMU	Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him.
938	CMU	There's not an iota of truth in it.
939	CMU	But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano.
940	CMU	Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me.
941	CMU	In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell.
942	CMU	Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest.
943	CMU	Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers.
944	CMU	Now just what do you want to know.
945	CMU	I want to know how all this is possible.
946	CMU	It's that much junk.
947	CMU	There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed.
948	CMU	He loved to play Chinese lottery.
949	CMU	The Law of Club and Fang
950	CMU	The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip.
951	CMU	And as never before, he was ready to obey.
952	CMU	This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego.
953	CMU	There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River.
954	CMU	We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed.
955	CMU	She was built primarily to sail.
956	CMU	In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors.
957	CMU	My age, in years, is twenty two.
958	CMU	I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page.
959	CMU	Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week.
960	CMU	Please do not think that I already know it all.
961	CMU	You see, we were teaching ourselves.
962	CMU	And now behold the perversity of things.
963	CMU	Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you.
964	CMU	Mr McVeigh told me about him.
965	CMU	Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance.
966	CMU	To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist.
967	CMU	Man could not conquer them.
968	CMU	Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved.
969	CMU	A scarlet loincloth completed his costume.
970	CMU	I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man.
971	CMU	Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast.
972	CMU	He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it.
973	CMU	And how would we ever find ourselves.
974	CMU	I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California.
975	CMU	A bush chief had died a natural death.
976	CMU	The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words.
977	CMU	Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia.
978	CMU	My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives.
979	CMU	It is merely the simple superlative.
980	CMU	I made no more overtures.
981	CMU	Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one.
982	CMU	The voyage was our idea of a good time.
983	CMU	At sea, Tuesday, March 17, 1908.
984	CMU	Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity.
985	CMU	I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.
986	CMU	The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper.
987	CMU	I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning.
988	CMU	The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing.
989	CMU	The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.
990	CMU	I have been robbed, sir, I amended.
991	CMU	You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began.
992	CMU	How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment.
993	CMU	I learned it myself in English ships.
994	CMU	An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others.
995	CMU	Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding.
996	CMU	Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply.
997	CMU	And each year something happened, and I did not go.
998	CMU	How in hell did he know it was you in the dark.
999	CMU	Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring.
1000	CMU	You have all the advantage.
1001	CMU	The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.
1002	CMU	Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour.
1003	CMU	He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough.
1004	CMU	Ah, it was sweet in my ears.
1005	CMU	He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure.
1006	CMU	It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.
1007	CMU	There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.
1008	CMU	I arose obediently and went down the beach.
1009	CMU	The next thing to watch out for is bed sores.
1010	CMU	At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy.
1011	CMU	Your father's fifth command, he nodded.
1012	CMU	On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised.
1013	CMU	She is essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the species.
1014	CMU	This was when the explosion occurred.
1015	CMU	Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter.
1016	CMU	It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into.
1017	CMU	There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green.
1018	CMU	The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out.
1019	CMU	The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine.
1020	CMU	The history of our westward-faring race is written in it.
1021	CMU	And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.
1022	CMU	They were babbling and chattering all together.
1023	CMU	Too much, he told me, with ominous rolling head.
1024	CMU	He is a candidate, rising from the serf class to our class.
1025	CMU	We are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners.
1026	CMU	The steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice.
1027	CMU	Well, did they eat.
1028	CMU	Famine had been my great ally.
1029	CMU	Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific.
1030	CMU	They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank.
1031	CMU	The land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton.
1032	CMU	There were stir and bustle, new faces, and fresh facts.
1033	CMU	And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember.
1034	CMU	He had become a man very early in life.
1035	CMU	I did not think you would be so early.
1036	CMU	He did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors.
1037	CMU	Mops, sir, eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel.
1038	CMU	Some one had thrust a large sheath-knife into his hand.
1039	CMU	O'Brien emitted a shriek that sank swiftly to a gurgling sob.
1040	CMU	Sandel would never become a world champion.
1041	CMU	Also, she wouldn't walk.
1042	CMU	To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself.
1043	CMU	You used to joyride like the very devil.
1044	CMU	They saw each other for the first time in Boston.
1045	CMU	Isaac Ford, the austere soldier of the Lord, the old hypocrite.
1046	CMU	Eighteen, he added.
1047	CMU	His reward should have been peace and repose.
1048	CMU	He was an amphibian and a mountaineer.
1049	CMU	It was sanctification and salvation.
1050	CMU	The history of the eighteenth century is written, Ernest prompted.
1051	CMU	They are not biologists nor sociologists.
1052	CMU	The more his opponents grew excited, the more Ernest deliberately excited them.
1053	CMU	By virtue of that power we shall remain in power.
1054	CMU	One guess will do, Ernest retorted.
1055	CMU	Take my advice and accept the vacation.
1056	CMU	I could not agree with Ernest.
1057	CMU	But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society.
1058	CMU	It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up.
1059	CMU	Let us run them for ourselves.
1060	CMU	It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio.
1061	CMU	Very few people knew of the existence of this law.
1062	CMU	The very thing, Ernest agreed.
1063	CMU	Also a fellow Senator, Chauncey Depew, said.
1064	CMU	Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import.
1065	CMU	Then there was the campaign.
1066	CMU	He was manifestly distressed by my coming.
1067	CMU	Not a wheel moved in his empire.
1068	CMU	The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution.
1069	CMU	You're going in for grab sharing.
1070	CMU	The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition.
1071	CMU	Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly.
1072	CMU	Without discussion, it was the agents provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt.
1073	CMU	The task we set ourselves was threefold.
1074	CMU	Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript.
1075	CMU	The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists.
1076	CMU	This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly.
1077	CMU	The mob came on, but it could not advance.
1078	CMU	But why continue the tirade, for tirade it was.
1079	CMU	After all superfluous flesh is gone what is left is stringy and resistant.
1080	CMU	Beyond refusing to sell us food, they left us to ourselves.
1081	CMU	He was a merry monarch, especially so for an Asiatic.
1082	CMU	What an excited whispering and conferring took place.
1083	CMU	Jacob Brinker, who was his roadmate, brought the news.
1084	CMU	Thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me.
1085	CMU	You yellow giant thing of the frost.
1086	CMU	Never so strange a prophet came up to Jerusalem.
1087	CMU	We who have endured so much surely can endure a little more.
1088	CMU	I have seen myself that one man contemplated by Pascal's philosophic eye.
1089	CMU	One great drawback to farming in California is our long dry summer.
1090	CMU	I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho, and shuddered inwardly.
1091	CMU	I said, and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about.
1092	CMU	Then came my boy code.
1093	CMU	And wherever I ranged, the way lay along alcohol-drenched roads.
1094	CMU	And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained.
1095	CMU	The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land.
1096	CMU	The life there was healthful and athletic, but too juvenile.
1097	CMU	How valiantly I went at it that first day.
1098	CMU	It would help to tide me along until I got steady employment.
1099	CMU	Did I possess too much vitality.
1100	CMU	In his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count.
1101	CMU	He had fulfilled his duty and paid properly.
1102	CMU	He knew what taboos he was violating.
1103	CMU	Do you value your hide.
1104	CMU	You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook.
1105	CMU	He plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again.
1106	CMU	Tomorrow or next day it might he gone.
1107	CMU	But already he had composed himself.
1108	CMU	Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction.
1109	CMU	Eggshell is not good to eat.
1110	CMU	But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village.
1111	CMU	Yea, I will tell thee.
1112	CMU	Hans hurled himself upon the prostrate man, striking madly with his fists.
1113	CMU	And he thought of Oona, and of her words.
1114	CMU	Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet.
1115	CMU	The Russian music player, the Count, was her obedient slave.
1116	CMU	So far as flags were concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction.
1117	CMU	New idea, he volunteered, brand new idea.
1118	CMU	Thirty pounds, said the captain with finality.
1119	CMU	The very idea of it was preposterous.
1120	CMU	Captain Doane's orders were swiftly obeyed.
1121	CMU	Come on, Del Mar challenged.
1122	CMU	He had a big chimpanzee that was a winner.
1123	CMU	I am sure it must have been some adventure.
1124	CMU	That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry.
1125	CMU	His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form.
1126	CMU	I'll tell you, the librarian said with a brightening face.
1127	CMU	He read his fragments aloud.
1128	CMU	Typhoid -- did I tell you.
1129	CMU	But she had become an automaton.
1130	CMU	At the best, they were necessary accessories.
1131	CMU	You were making them talk shop, Ruth charged him.
