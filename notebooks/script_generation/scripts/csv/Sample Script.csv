3	Wikipedia	Problem solving: Military science	"In military science, problem solving is linked to the concept of ""end-states"", the desired condition or situation that strategists wish to generate. The ability to solve problems is important at any military rank, but is highly critical at the command and control level, where it is strictly correlated to the deep understanding of qualitative and quantitative scenarios. Effectiveness of problem solving is ""a criterion used to assess changes in system behavior, capability, or operational environment that is tied to measuring the attainment of an end state, achievement of an objective, or creation of an effect"". Planning for problem-solving is a ""process that determines and describes how to employ 'means' in specific 'ways' to achieve 'ends'."""

In the darkest shadows and in the most ordinary places.
These are the true stories o the innocent and the unimaginable.

Between the world we see and the things we fear.
There are doors.
When they are opened.
Nightmares become reality."

8	Wikipedia	Problem solving: Mental set	Mental set was first articulated by Abraham Luchins in the 1940s and demonstrated in his well-known water jug experiments. In these experiments, participants were asked to fill one jug with a specific amount of water using only other jugs with different maximum capacities as tools. After Luchins gave his participants a set of water jug problems that could all be solved by employing a single technique, he would then give them a problem that could either be solved using that same technique or a novel and simpler method. Luchins discovered that his participants tended to use the same technique that they had become accustomed to despite the possibility of using a simpler alternative. Thus mental set describes one's inclination to attempt to solve problems in such a way that has proved successful in previous experiences. However, as Luchins' work revealed, such methods for finding a solution that have worked in the past may not be adequate or optimal for certain new but similar problems. Therefore, it is often necessary for people to move beyond their mental sets in order to find solutions. This was again demonstrated in Norman Maier's 1931 experiment, which challenged participants to solve a problem by using a household object in an unconventional manner. Maier observed that participants were often unable to view the object in a way that strayed from its typical use, a phenomenon regarded as a particular form of mental set. When people cling rigidly to their mental sets, they are said to be experiencing fixation, a seeming obsession or preoccupation with attempted strategies that are repeatedly unsuccessful. In the late 1990s, researcher Jennifer Wiley worked to reveal that expertise can work to create a mental set in persons considered to be experts in certain fields, and she furthermore gained evidence that the mental set created by expertise could lead to the development of fixation.
9	Edge Studio	A story	"Every moment has a story. And every story matters

The first men painted stories on stone walls, the ancient Egyptians chose the chisel instead.

The Incans told story with dances and fire, aborigines told it with star and spear.

Stories are at the very essence of human life. They count the breaths of every sunrise, the beats of every emotion and the silence of every heart. Stories take the fleeting temporal and makes them eternal."

12	Wikipedia	Creativity: Ancient views	"Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece, Ancient China, and Ancient India, lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to ""to create"" or ""creator"" except for the expression ""poiein"", which only applied to poiesis and to the poietes who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in The Republic, ""Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?"", he answers, ""Certainly not, he merely imitates.""It is commonly argued that the notion of ""creativity"" originated in Western culture through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration. According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, ""the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the Genesis."" However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work. A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods. Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative ""daemon"" or ""genius"", linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance. It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of ""great men""."

17	Wikipedia	Whistleblower: Origin of term	"U.S. civic activist Ralph Nader is said to have coined the phrase, but he in fact put a positive spin on the term in the early 1970s to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as ""informer"" and ""snitch"". However, the origins of the word date back to the 19th century.
The word is linked to the use of a whistle to alert the public or a crowd about a bad situation, such as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game. The phrase whistle blower attached itself to law enforcement officials in the 19th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police. Sports referees, who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play, also were called whistle blowers.An 1883 story in the Janesville Gazette called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a whistle blower, without the hyphen. By the year 1963, the phrase had become a hyphenated word, whistle-blower. The word began to be used by journalists in the 1960s for people who revealed wrongdoing, such as Nader. It eventually evolved into the compound word whistleblower."
