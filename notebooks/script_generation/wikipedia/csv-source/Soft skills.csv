1	Soft skills: History	"Since 1959, the U.S. Army has been investing a considerable amount of resources into technology-based development of training procedures. In 1968 the U.S. Army officially introduced a training doctrine known as ""Systems Engineering of Training"" covered in the document CON Reg 350-100-1.PG Whitmore cited the CON Reg 350-100-1 definition: ""job related skills involving actions affecting primarily people and paper, e.g., inspecting troops, supervising office personnel, conducting studies, preparing maintenance reports, preparing efficiency reports, designing bridge structures.""At the 1972 CONARC Soft Skills Conference Dr. Whitmore presented a report aimed at figuring out how the term ""soft skills"" is understood in various CONARC schools. After designing and processing a questionnaire, the following tentative definition was formulated: ""Soft skills are important job-related skills that involve little or no interaction with machines and whose application on the job is quite generalized.""They further criticized state of the concept then as vague with a remark ""in other words, those job functions about which we know a good deal are hard skills and those about which we know very little are soft skills."" Another immediate study by them also concluded in a negative tone.Psychologist Nicholas Humphrey famously stated that it is social intelligence that defines humans rather than quantitative intelligence. Many industries today give prominence to soft skills of their employees. It is through a 1972 US Army training manual identified formal usage of the term ""soft skills"" began."
2	Soft skills: Concept	Soft skills are a cluster of productive personality traits that characterize one's relationships in a milieu. These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, language skills, personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits. A definition based on review literature explains soft skills as an umbrella term for skills under three key functional elements: people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes. National Business Education Association deems soft skills as critical for being industrious in today’s workplace. Soft skills complement hard skills also known as technical skills, for productive workplace performance and everyday life competencies. Hard skills were the only skills necessary for career employment and were generally quantifiable and measurable from educational background, work experience or through interview. In the 20th century soft skills are a major differentiator, a sine qua non for employability and success in life. A study conducted by Harvard University noted that 80% of achievements in career are determined by soft skills and only 20% by hard skills. Experts say soft skills training should begin for a person when they are students, to perform efficiently in their academic environment as well as in their future workplace. A public interest study conducted by McDonald’s in UK predicted over half a million people will be held back from job sectors by 2020 due to lack of soft skills.
3	Soft skills: Enumeration and categorization	A person's soft skill is an important part of their individual contribution to the success of an organization. Organizations which deal with customers face-to-face are generally more successful if they promote activities for staffs to develop these skills through wellness enhancing programs. Training or rewarding for personal habits  or traits such as dependability and conscientiousness can yield significant return on investment for an organization. For this reason, soft skills are increasingly sought out by employers in addition to standard qualifications. Studies by Stanford Research Institute and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation among Fortune 500 CEOs established that 75% of long term job success resulted from soft skills and only 25% from technical skills. Hence, soft skills are as important as cognitive/technical skills.
