1	A Haunting Title	"In this world, there is real evil.
In the darkest shadows and in the most ordinary places.
These are the true stories o the innocent and the unimaginable.

Between the world we see and the things we fear.
There are doors.
When they are opened.
Nightmares become reality."
2	A story	"Every moment has a story. And every story matters

The first men painted stories on stone walls, the ancient Egyptians chose the chisel instead.

The Incans told story with dances and fire, aborigines told it with star and spear.

Stories are at the very essence of human life. They count the breaths of every sunrise, the beats of every emotion and the silence of every heart. Stories take the fleeting temporal and makes them eternal."

5	Abiogenic Theory	The abiogenic theory holds that hydrocarbons were a component of the material that formed the earth, through accretion of solids, some 4.5 billion years ago. With increasing internal heat, liquids and gases were liberated, and because they were less dense than the rocks, buoyancy forces drove them upward. In favorable conditions, the upward journey from the regions of origin would be dammed temporarily in porous rocks at depths that our drills can reach, and from which we then derive commercial petroleum.
6	Adopted Children Seeking Biological Parents	"Adopted Children Seeking Biological Parents
It is natural for an adopted child to be curious about his or her biological parents or siblings. By collecting as much background information as you can during the adoption process, you may be able to satisfactorily answer some of your child's questions. At least until he or she is old enough or able to get further information on their own."

8	Adopted Children Seeking Birth Parents	Adopted children are naturally curious about their birth parents and siblings. Gathering as much background information during the adoption process will prove to be helpful as your child grows. Having concrete answers to your child’s questions will provide a foundation for future conversations. This kind of honesty is essential for building a solid relationship. It also creates an environment for a grown child to confidently pursue additional information on their own.
9	Air Processor 2000	To install a new capsule into your air purifier, switch the unit “off.” Then remove the new capsule from it’s protective wrapping. Open the capsule cap by turning in the direction opposite to that indicated by the arrow on the cap. Insert the capsule in the cap until the tabs catch the cap. Insert the complete cap into the air purifier. Turn the cap in the direction of the arrow. And then switch the unit back “on.” Your air purifier will now release a pleasant fragrance during operation. Either choose “repeat” to watch this demonstration again, or it will automatically close.
10	Alexander Solzhenitsyn Nobel Lecture (Excerpt)	A work of art contains its verification in itself; artificial, strained concepts do not withstand the test of being turned into images; they fall to pieces, turn out to be sickly and pale, convince no one. Works which draw on truth and present it to us in live and concentrated form grip us, compellingly involve us, and no one ever, not even ages hence, will come forth to refute them.

17	Availability	Availability of business applications is required for a company to stay competitive, productive, and profitable. Application users require availability or else the business suffers. Service providers must establish an infrastructure to support the availability requirements, or they may be subject to fines and penalties. Unavailability is visible to the organization, to the organization's customers, and to the media. Attaining the desired availability does not happen by just installing lots of hardware or software. It must be planned, designed, and implemented using specific techniques.

19	Baby Massage	This video is for parents…and grandparents…and for you, because you want your baby to thrive. For a baby, touch is talk. Touch is the most developed sense a small baby has. Skin to skin contact is a powerful way to communicate with your baby before your baby can talk to you. Give your baby the gift of feeling deeply connected to you. Make sure your child knows what positive touch is all about. Create a deep and lasting bond. Years later, when your grown child gives you a big hug or confides in you, you will be glad that you gave them a special way of communicating with you.
20	Bacteria	"The bacteria are assigned to the kingdom Monera, also called Prokaryotae.  On average, the prokaryotic cells of bacteria are much smaller, and much simpler in structure, than eukaryotic cells.  Most prokaryotes are one-celled, although many kinds occur as filaments (strings) or clumps of independent cells.
	Some bacterial fossils date from 3.5 billion years ago, long before the evolution of cells recognizable as eukaryotes of the modern type.  Today, bacteria are still by far the most numerous organisms, flourishing in almost every conceivable habitat, including our own bodies."

And where else better to begin than drills. Listed for you are the five most important drills: lead-up, breakdown drills, secondary breaks drills, ……."
24	Beginning Scuba	"During open water certification, a scuba diver is taught that the most important rule in scuba diving is to breathe continuously and to avoid holding his breath underwater. But why is this rule so important?
 Scuba diving is different from snorkeling or free diving. When a snorkeler or freediver takes a breath from the surface and dives down, the air in his lungs compresses due to the pressure of the water.
 Steps to Avoid a Pulmonary Barotrauma
A lung over-pressurization injury is known as a pulmonary barotrauma, and can occur at both microscopic and macroscopic levels if a diver holds his breath and ascends. A pulmonary barotrauma is a dangerous injury because it can force air into a divers chest cavity or blood stream.
 The Take Home Message About the Most Important Rule in Scuba Diving:
The rule to never hold your breath when scuba diving is important both for dive safety and dive efficiency. A diver who holds his breath underwater will not decrease his air consumption or prolong his dive. He merely increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in his lungs which makes him feel starved for air."
25	Berlitz - The German Coast Guard	"Improve your English.

Berlitz

Language for life."
26	Bicycle	) A bicycle can be among a runner’s most valuable tools for training the body to shift into gear, develop quicker turnover, create more power and reach peak racing shape. Begin by replacing one or two of your weekly easy runs with a 60- to 90-minute bike session. After a few weeks, replace one of your weekly fast running workouts by ramping up the intensity and adding intervals in the middle of a ride. The primary goal should be to mimic the neuromuscular cadence of quick leg turnover while running.
27	Biogenetic Law	Commonly summarized as “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” (on-TA-jeh-nee re-cah-PIT-you-lates fill-AH-jeh-nee), biogenetic law posits that the embryonic stages in the development of an individual (its ontogeny) repeat the evolutionary history of its ancestors (its phylogeny). A corollary of the biogenetic law is the idea that new evolutionary features are typically added at the end of development, with formerly adult, or “terminal” stages gradually being compressed into progressively earlier stages (or sometimes being eliminated outright).

31	C++ Developing an Application	"Developing an Application

The application you'll create (called Myapp) is a subset of the VIEWEX sample application provided with the MFC samples.  Myapp lets you open new child windows, each displaying an initial message, in a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) application. When you choose Change Text from the Text menu in Myapp, a dialog box opens and allows you to change the text of the message in the currently active child window.

Myapp starts as a default application created by AppWizard. You'll add eight lines of code to this starter application to print a message when each new document window (MDI child window) is opened.  Then, you'll create a dialog box for editing the message and add a menu command for opening the dialog box."
32	Cabinet Construction	"Whether you're building a dresser, a kitchen cabinet or bathroom vanity; basic cabinet construction is the same. A cabinet consists of a case with two sides, bottom and top, and a back and front. 

The front may contain drawers, doors or shelves; or a combination of all three. The simplest case construction is a box made of plywood. The case can be painted or stained and varnished. Solid wood can be used as a more decorative material for the small facer pieces. If a side is to be concealed against a wall, that side can be made out of a more economical plywood. However, all exposed sides should be cut from a good hardwood or smooth softwood surfaced plywood.

You can construct a customized kitchen cabinet to fit any space or you can make them smaller units and join them in the same fashion. Shown are the typical dimensions of a kitchen cabinet base with applied facers. The upper cabinet is built in a very similar fashion. Shown is the typical construction of an upper kitchen cabinet with applied facers. 

The first step is to cut out pieces to size. Cut a one quarter inch by one quarter inch rabbet in the inside back edge of each side piece for the cabinet back. Then, assemble the basic box with glue and screws or nails. Cut the side facers and apply glue to the case edge. Align the facer flush with the case edge and then fasten in place with finishing nails. Set the nail head slightly below the wood surface with a punch. Then, measure the upper facer to fit precisely between the two side facers."
33	Calculus	The processes which Calculus illuminates are distributed over an enormous range in the physical sciences, from the motions of the stars to the behavior of nuclear particles; in biological sciences, from basic growth to communication problems; and in the social sciences, from population studies to the theoretical basis for scientific decision making. Calculus can be applied to any problems involving extreme amounts, such as the most, the fastest, the least, or the slowest, which may be described as values for which a certain rate of change is zero.
34	Caulking Material	For caulking material to be effective, it must bead across the gap between the materials and remain flexible as the changing temperature causes the materials to move. Improper or inadequate caulking can cause several problems. For one, there’s poor control of heat. That is, heat infiltrates in the summer and escapes in the winter, causing higher utility bills. Uncomfortable drafts may occur. Water may seep into the house and cause paint failure, mildew, and rotting. And in severe cases, even structural damage can be caused. In addition, exposed cracks make an attractive nesting area for insects.
35	Central Limit Theorem	"If samples of a population with size n are drawn, and the values of x-bar are calculated for each sample group, and the distribution of x-bar is found, the distribution’s shape is found to approach a normal distribution for sufficiently large n.  This theorem allows one to use the assumption of a normal distribution when dealing with x-bar. “Sufficiently large” depends on the population’s distribution and what range of x-bar is being considered; for practical purposes, the easiest approach may be to take a number
 of samples of a desired size and see if their means are normally distributed. If not, the sample size should be increased."
36	Checking Account (dialogue)	"Banker:	  Good morning, how can I help you today?

Customer: 	I’d like to open a checking account.

Banker:	 Great! I can help you with that. Please sit down, my   name is John.

Customer: 	Hi, thanks, I’m Brian.

Banker: 	Okay Brian, great.  Is this going to be a personal checking account?

Customer:  	Yes, thanks.

Banker:  	Do you have any identification?

Customer: 	Well, I forgot my license, but I do have my Visa card, will that do?"
37	Company Website Greeting	"Meet Bob. Like 95% of car shoppers, he uses his computer, smartphone and tablet to shop for his next car.A few years ago, you could have reached Bob through traditional means such as Direct mail, TV or radio, and newspaper ads.Today, that simply isn't enough.
According to Google - consumers visit 18 websites on average - before stepping into a dealership."
38	Composites	Composites are a pre-designed combination of fibrous reinforcements held together by a polymer matrix. Reinforcements can be aramid, carbon, or glass fibers, and the matrix either a thermoset or a thermoplastic resin. Product forms include unidirectional tape, woven fabrics, or continuous filaments which can be layered or wrapped in various orientations. When heat treated and pressure consolidated, they form laminates or structures that are stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. Chief among the advantages of polymer matrix composites is their light weight coupled with high stiffness and strength along the direction of the reinforcement. This combination is basis of their usefulness in a wide variety of structural applications.

41	Confidence with Women	"Remember our conversation about money from the last chapter? Let me refresh your memory: it’s a commonly held belief that women are attracted to men with money. The reason women seem to fall for wealthy men is that humans work on what is called a “slippery slope mentality,” which means that our thought processes typically follow an “If this, then that” pattern. When a woman sees a man with money, she might automatically think “Hm…this could be the man for me. I can have whatever I want. I will be treated well.” But subconsciously, there’s a lot more going on than the simple
“I can get free stuff” thought process. After all, there are lots of guys out there who would treat her well – a bum could be the most loving and attentive boyfriend she’s ever had! – but she’s probably not going to be attracted to them because there are other factors at play in these situations.

Women understand that having money is indicative of other desirable qualities that make a man valuable, including confidence. Think back to what we went over earlier: if you have money, you probably had to work for it. If you earned that much money working, you probably hold a powerful position in which many people depend on you. Women typically find the idea that a man being capable of performing under extreme amounts of pressure to be highly attractive.

Women also like men in leadership positions because it signifies that people follow them, trust them, and place value in their opinions and ideas. A man like that is able to make other people feel valuable simply because they are
with them. Confidence, essentially, is the possession of the ability to increase the value of others around you. That’s why guys who don’t have money but do demonstrate this quality are still able to attract beautiful, self-assured women."
42	Cooking For Kids	Cooking is a great thing to start teaching kids at an early age. I grew up in a family full of great cooks and chefs. Watching them prepare wonderful meals or just a good sandwich was always fun to me and developed my love for cooking.
43	Creativity	Creativity is not the same as hard work or effort, it requires genuine inspiration. It is the product of a mind thoroughly intrigued by a question a situation or a possibility, therefore creativity does not come in exchange for money or rewards but when we focus our attention on something because we want to. 
44	Credit Pursuit	"Another way to improve your credit is to go to two or three banks and obtain a certificate of deposit in each. Find out the minimum amount of installment loan that each bank will take. Then, use at least that amount for the CD. If the minimum amount is $1,000 dollars, then that is the amount of the CD.

About two weeks later, return to those banks and ask to borrow the same amount of money you already have on deposit. Offer to use the CD as collateral for the loan. Make sure that each loan is an installment loan of six months or longer. This is necessary to ensure that the loan goes onto your credit report. Bankers are very comfortable in making these loans because the collateral is right there in their own bank. The interest will be minimal as well, since most are only 2-3% over the amount you will be earning with the CD.

Don't be shy about informing the banker that you are attempting to establish credit with their bank. Bankers will, after all, inquire as to the purpose for the loan. If done correctly and payments are made on time, it will be totally possible to eventually take out a mortgage with the bank in the future. Bankers will love the long term planning idea and it builds trust, which is hard to purchase in any situation. 

When you have obtained the loan, take the money and place it into an interest bearing account. You will use that money, plus the interest it earns, to help pay back the banks. You will then receive a payment book of coupons, or some alternative record keeping method for making those payments on the loan. You'll then make one payment every Friday for the next month. It will help with credibility and trust to perhaps make one or two payments personally with the loan officer themselves. After this first month, simply make the rest of the payments monthly until the secured loan is paid off. 

Now you have retired the loan faster than the payoff period and you also have three references for credit. On credit applications be sure to include the name or names of the loan officers you worked with, for you can be sure that credit grantors will be calling those persons for information about you and your credit worthiness. 

Once you have completed this technique, go back to those banks and apply for a $500 dollar line of unsecured credit with a 60 to 90 day loan. Then as before, pay ahead of schedule. You will then be able to go back every six months to those same banks and apply for larger and larger amounts and create an unsecured line of credit."

46	Cut A Rug	It's a scientific fact (or should be, anyway) that surviving winter requires an extra dose of the warm and fuzzies. You can generate them with anything handmade, and recycling something in an unusual and useful way definitely provides your daily requirement. So cut up your old, torn, battered, stained t-shirts. We know you'll enjoy weaving yourself a soft and sweet, warm and fuzzy rag rug. It's a fun snowy afternoon project - deceptively easy and even a little addictive. Once you've made your loom, you'll find that one rug is never enough. First, cut the body of 7 or 8 medium and large t-shirts horizontally into 3-inch wide strips. Don't cut the side seams, as these strips are the loops you weave with. Next, stretch the t-shirt loops the long way across the frame to create the warp. Note how the stretched loops become two strings across the frame. Hook those loops on the nail posts. To create the Weft, we begin working on the shorter axis. Weave the end of a loop under one string, then over the next string, then under again all the way across the warp strings.

50	Dinosaurs 2	They were awesome creatures, the great reptiles of eons and eras past. To modern eyes, they appear magnificent ... grotesque ... and terrifying. And in fact, it seems inconceivable that their dominance of the planet could ever have ended. But end it did ... at the hands of an even mightier adversary: Change. It was, of course, nature that dealt the most severe blows. Over the yawning ages, the great beasts were beset in turn by drought ... by flood ... by fire ... and ultimately, by ice. Nimbler, more resourceful species were able to adapt to these catastrophically shifting conditions, and survived. But the colossal reptiles were simply too ponderous, too inflexible to adapt.

58	Early Childhood Brain Development	The first three years of life are a period of incredible growth in all areas of a baby's development. A newborn's brain is about 25 percent of its approximate adult weight. But by age 3, it has grown dramatically by producing billions of cells and hundreds of trillions of connections, or synapses, between these cells. In this section you will learn about the many ways parents and caregivers can help children get off to a good start and establish healthy patterns for life-long learning.

62	Educational Video (Learning Financial Terms)	"As a business owner, you know you need to look at your financial statements to understand the health of your business and how to plan for growth. But if you’ve ever felt confused trying to understand financial terms, you’re not alone. Here are 13 basic terms you’ll need to find your way around your financial statements.
Let’s start with revenue and expenses.
Revenue is what a business earns when it sells a product or service. When this restaurant’s customers pay by cash or card, or are sent an invoice for catering completed, that’s revenue, even if cash isn’t received right away.
An expense is when resources are used to generate revenue. Paying a supplier, employees, the rent and utilities are all common expenses. But again, this may not mean that cash is paid out. When the restaurant pays a vendor in cash, credit, or check, it’s an expense.
In managing your business, it’s important to recognize the difference between two kinds of expenses: Costs of Goods Sold, or Cost of Sales, and Operating Expenses"
63	Educator Effectiveness Training Module	In both rating years and non-rating years, the educator effectiveness process includes several steps. These steps help educators to set, refine and document their progress towards individualized goals for student and educator growth. They also help educators get tailored support from evaluators and peers to meet their goals. Although teachers and principals will be evaluated using different rubrics, the steps in the evaluation process are the same. We'll walk through these steps now.
64	Electricity	Electricity has become the most important source of energy in the world, yet no one has ever seen an electrical charge, and until this century, it was impossible to isolate and study individual charges of electricity. Electricity is a natural phenomenon that comes about because of the negatively and positively charged particles of matter. These particles are tiny parts of atoms, called protons and electrons. When a substance is in its normal state, the charges on these particles are more or less in balance. The natural arrangement of protons and electrons in a substance is a disorganized one. However, when something changes the material -- something as simple as vibration, friction, heat, or being close to another substance –
65	Emotional Quotient	Psychological researchers have found that when it comes to predicting success, your brain power matters much less than your emotional power. They call this emotional intelligence, or EQ - your Emotional Quotient.
66	Equinox	"Twice a year, day and night fall into balance, lasting for nearly equal lengths. Known as “equinoxes”, Latin for “equal night” they occur in March and September, and along with solstices, mark the changing of seasons as earth travels around the sun.
Astronomers like to describe the equinox within the conceptual celestial sphere. Here the heavens are projected around the earth, like an enormous planetarium. The model is bisected by the celestial equator, a projection of earth’s own equator. The equinox occurs at the point at which the sun’s path, or ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator.  In spring it is known as the vernal equinox, and in fall, the autumnal equinox.  The other two seasonal points on the sun’s path are the solstices. In the northern hemisphere, the summer solstice marks the longest day of the year, while the winter solstice marks the shortest.
The seasonal aligning of the sun has been more than just a unique celestial event for humankind throughout history. Ancient sites like Stonehenge in England and Machu Picchu in Peru have well-documented solar alignments during the solstices.  Similarly, the equinoxes have been associated with some amazing man-made phenomenon. In the ancient Mayan city of Chechen Itza, the great pyramid known as El Castillo is oriented along cardinal axes. During the equinoxes, shadows cast by the railings create the illusion of a writhing serpent body, descending the northern steps where it joins the carved serpent’s head at the base of the stairway.
The cultural significance of the fall equinox and the changing of seasons continue today, especially in the northern hemisphere, where the autumnal equinox occurs around harvest season. In fact, the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox is commonly referred to as the “Harvest Moon”.
In China and other countries this time is celebrated with the mid-autumnal festival.  The origins are linked to the birth of the moon goddess,  and festival traditions revolve around families, with reunions and feasts, and special moon cakes.  In Jewish cultures, thanks for the harvest is given during the week long “feast of the tabernacles” of Succoth. Families eat meals in temporary shelters outside, recalling the Israelites days in the wilderness after the exodus from Egypt."
67	Essential Oils	"Essential oils are organic compounds extracted from plants with tremendous healing properties. Using essential oils for healing purposes is often called aromatherapy, which is a holistic treatment seeking to improve physical, mental and emotional health.
For over 5,000 years, many different cultures have used these healing plant oils for a variety of health conditions. They are often used for relaxation, beauty care, home cleaning and most often used as natural medicine.
Just adding some of the most common essential oils like lavender, frankincense, lemon, peppermint and tea tree oil to your natural medicine cabinet can:
•	Fight cold and flu symptoms
•	Relax your body and soothe sore muscles
•	Heal skin conditions
•	Alleviate pain
•	Balance hormones
•	Improve digestion
•	Reduce cellulite and wrinkles
•	Clean your home
•	And are often used in homemade personal care products"
68	Evernote New Enhancements	"Popular iOS app Evernote has just been updated to bring a number of customization options and other improvements.

Probably the biggest change in version 7.3 of the app is the redesigned homescreen. Along with a revamped New Note button on top of the screen, users can select from the three pictured color themes – light, dark, and classic green. Users can also choose exactly what sections they want to display and arrange them in any order.

To quickly jump to a specific section, users can choose to display recently viewed items in the Notes, Notebooks, Shortcuts, and Tags section. The update also ushers in the new sync status bar that is displayed below the Settings gear."
69	Facebook Etiquette	"Hey Facebook users – uh, here are a couple of suggestions if you're over the age of nine…

Some people have this idea that the number of ""friends"" you have on Facebook is a status of your popularity in real life. That may be true if these ""friends"" are people whom you know offline, and not strangers whom you randomly add while browsing through the Facebook network. But, hey, go ahead and let everyone know that you have 2300 ""friends."" That's sure to convince people that you're really popular.

Secondly, no one cares what you ate last night unless Oprah's personal chef cooked it or a naked Kardashian served it to you personally. Stop posting about your wonderful dinner at the Olive Garden, because the only person who wants to hear about it is Olive Garden's customer service. We all understand that your dinner was one of the best of your life, but let's face it: we'd rather look at pictures of babies and kittens than hear about your Fettucini Alfredo."
70	Family Walk – Radio Program	"If you could find a way for mom to lose weight, for dad to prevent a heart attack, and for junior to get hooked on exercise, wouldn’t you do it?  Well, put on your shoes and start walking together.
In today’s HEALTH TIPS, we take a closer look at the physical, as well as the mental benefits, of walking.  Did you know that nearly 70 million Americans currently enjoy a regular walking program, making it the number one exercise choice in the country?  The best thing parents can do is to set an example for their kids.  In addition to walking together, parents can stress the positive aspects of exercise, things like family participation, freedom, and fun.  The only equipment you need is a comfortable pair of shoes with good support."
71	Fax E-learning	Telephone networks are duplex analog lines and were originally designed to carry only voice signals. But computer data is digital and must be converted to an analog signal by a modem. The sending modem converts the digital data to analog, and then sends the signal to the receiving modem which converts it back to digital. The receiving fax then prints the image.
72	Film vs. Digital Cameras	Traditional film cameras still hold many advantages over digital cameras, starting with their lower average cost. If you plan to travel, you may not want to spend your time worrying about memory cards and batteries. Film cameras use film that is readily available around the globe, and their batteries tend to last exponentially longer than the batteries of their digital counterparts. Film cameras typically yield better results when shooting in low-light situations (especially without a flash) or when capturing action shots, whether it's your children's soccer matches or the running of the bulls in Pamplona.

74	Financial Privacy	"A new federal law gives you some minimal rights to protect your personal financial information. The law gives you the right to prevent a company you do business with from sharing or selling certain sensitive information to non-affiliated third parties. The term ""opt-out"" means that unless and until you inform your bank, credit card company, insurance company, or brokerage firm that you do not want them to share or sell your customer data, they are free to do so."
75	Fly Fishing	"You are about to start a lifetime trip to a world of discovery. Through fly fishing, you will learn to see creatures invisible to other people. You will discover a new world of literature, new friends, new places - far flung and near at hand, and all interesting.

The fly rod is an extraordinary fishing tool, enabling you to catch fish when other anglers cannot. Once you learn the rhythm of the rod, however, simply fishing with it may become more gratifying than catching with it. The rhythm of the rod carries your body, mind, and spirit to the water. Whether you catch a fish or not, the water will always give you a little of its strength, some of its energy, and much of its peace. As you fall asleep after a day of fly fishing, you can feel the rhythm of the rod and of the water."

78	Gardening	"Gardening

Section 3: Whacking Weeds. When weeds do rear their ugly little sprouts, follow the regimen below - the sooner the better. Like unwanted guests, if you allow them to settle in, it's hard to make them leave! Number 1: PULL. Don't just yank off the tops; dig up that root system too. Don't throw weeds on the ground; some varieties easily resprout. Number 2: MOW. Sometimes simply cutting the weeds to the ground will stunt their growth. It's a good place to start when the patch is large. Follow up with pulling, hoeing, or weed-control treatments. Number 3: HOE. This tried-and-true method chops up those stalks and roots. The more elbow grease, the better. Poison ivy and other menacing plants should never be pulled, chopped, burned, or mowed because then their irritating substances can spread through the air and on clothes. To remove hazardous plants, rely on a defoliating spray or a professional service. There are organic products specially developed to defoliate poison ivy or eliminate moss growth. See our resources section in the manual that accompanied this program for a listing of suppliers."
79	Glamour Beauty Tip	How to wear sparkly makeup in the daytime: Think any woman who's walking around in broad daylight with gold-and-silver slicked eyes, cheeks and lips must be headed to work at the BadaBing? Fuggedaboudit. You can wear metallics to brunch or even your straitlaced office this season. Apply them with a light touch (a little glint goes a long way): A thin streak of silver eyeliner brightens eyes; a lightly bronzed blush looks gorgeously healthy; sheer-gold-toe nails are flat out fun. Don't plaster metallics on your brow bone. Do highlight one feature with metallics.
80	Gold	Is gold a good investment? Turn to page eight and your instructors will explain the two graphs. The first graph represents the buying value of gold as it changed from 1920 to 1981. We thought you’d remember the title better if you wrote it in yourself. It is: Retained Purchasing Power of Gold. This represented the actual price of gold adjusted for the United States retail price index, a more accurate measure of its worth. It is true that for much of this century gold prices were arbitrarily controlled by our government. This ended in two steps. In 1971 the government announced it would no longer redeem the balance of trade payments in gold.
81	Gold Mastercard	As a valued Gold MasterCard holder, you now have the opportunity to select your own Personal Identification Number. Choosing your own unique PIN makes it easy to remember, and completely confidential. Simply choose any four-digit number. We suggest you choose a number that has personal meaning only to you. Your PIN will make it even easier to use your Gold MasterCard at the thousands of participating ATMs and financial institutions around the country. Imagine ready cash when you need it...Remember, your Gold MasterCard also gives you increased purchasing power at over 12 million merchants, service centers, and restaurants worldwide.
82	Golf Tips Magazine	In the “Star Wars” movies, the Jedi Knights harnessed the mystical powers of The Force to fight the Evil Empire. Wouldn’t it be great to call upon an all-powerful energy to fight ‘Ol Man Bogey? Truth is, you can, by harnessing the forces of simple physics. In order to move any object, force must be applied. If you paid attention in high-school physics, you would be aware of this…and you would recall Newton’s second law of motion. Newton tells us that force is a combination of mass and acceleration. So, the way to hit a golf ball farther is to apply greater force. By swinging the mass of the clubhead with maximum acceleration, which is in itself a function of speed, you’ll increase the length of your drives. So, next time on the tee…may The Force be with you.
83	Gourd Garland	To make one, you will need miniature gourds, a drill with a fine bit, and twine. Drill a hole through the center of each gourd. Thread twine through an embroidery needle; run it through the holes, knotting it at both sides of each gourd to secure in place. We left 6 inches between gourds. Hang garland from tacks or nails, indoors or outside.
84	Grammar Smart	Hello, and welcome to the Princeton Review's Grammar Smart audio program. This course is designed to help you clean up your grammar and improve the way you communicate. While we're not going to go into great detail about how or why the rules that dictate how we talk evolved, or even what they mean, we will cover the basics and help you avoid common grammatical pitfalls. Why don't we begin by introducing the parts of speech.
85	Great Movies	"Lights. Camera. Action! Great movies can kindle curiosity, teach kids important life lessons and make it easier for parents and kids to discuss sensitive issues. Be sure to take time to ask questions, role play and extend the program with related books and activities. Take turns selecting the evening's films, so everyone plays a role in movie night. Take advantage of DVDs with added footage and commentary from actors and directors. They can give interesting insights into how movies are made, how special effects are created and more. Give your own movie reviews afterwards or create your own ""rating"" system."
86	Growing Orchids	What to keep in mind about growing orchids. While each type of orchid has its own care requirements, the following five factors affect all blooms: Light: The plant’s tender leaves can be burned by too much direct sunlight, Yet, insufficient light stunts the growth of certain varieties. Temperature: Orchids that require cooler temperatures can often be well-placed in a low spot near the floor; plants needing warmer environment might do better up on shelves. In general, avoid putting orchids in drafty shelves. Humdity: Orchids love moisture and thrive with frequent misting. Fertilizer: While healthy orchids require plenty of nutrients, too much plant food can cause blackened leaf-tips. Water: It’s usually best to water in the morning so moisture has time to evaporate from the plant throughout the day.
87	Guide to Recording Voice	"Recording a person speaking is quite straightforward and getting good results shouldn't be too hard, given the right environment and equipment.

If you are using a close-micing technique, which is necessary with a cardioid condenser microphone, you will want to place a pop-shield between the mic and the person speaking. Pop-shields protect the microphone from bursts of air known as plosives, which occur when a person makes 'puh' and 'buh' sounds with their voice. Pop-shields are not necessary for boundary or lapel microphones, as they are not being spoken into directly.

Positioning of your microphone depends on the type of microphone you're using and your environment. Recording should always be done in the quietest possible space, preferably far away from noisy computers and other electrical equipment.  You will be surprised how much microphones can pick up. In an ideal world, this room should also be fairly spacious and filled with soft furnishings, which absorb reflected sound. This isn't always realistic. Not everybody has a specially treated sound booth in their house! 

To minimize the noise from errant pieces of equipment, start by positioning them as far away from the microphone as your space will allow. Secondly, cardioid microphones are directional, and will pick up most of their sound from the direction you point them in. Point your microphone away from any noisy equipment, and  place some soft, absorbent material behind the subject you are recording to minimize reflections. This will go a long way to reducing the sound of the room in your recordings. Smaller rooms suffer greatly from these reflections. They feed back into the microphone and 'color' the sound of your voice, making the recording sound cheap and unprofessional. Taking these simple steps should go a long way to making sure you end up with a clean, professional sounding recording.

In terms of volume, people tend to stay at a fairly consistent level. Once you have your equipment set up and your presenter(s) in place, ask them to speak a few lines in order to get your levels set up correctly for each microphone. Aim to light up your level meter (either on your mixer or in your wave editing software) so that it peaks around -6db. This will ensure you get a healthy signal level. But leave enough room for unexpected rises in volume without 'clipping'. Clipping occurs when the microphone detects a signal louder than the computer can record. This results in unpleasant-sounding distortion, which is to be avoided at all costs. 

Once you have all your equipment set up and your levels set optimally, it's time to hit record and get down to business!
Depending on the type of project you're working on, you may be recording many separate parts of voice, which will be interspersed with music or other content. Thanks to the wonders of digital editing, you can record all these pieces back to back and simply position them where you want in the wave editor afterwards. The same goes for any mistakes you might make. Simply carry on recording and cut out the bits you don't want in your editor later.

Additional Vocal Processing (chapter)

Once you have finished recording your vocal content, you may play it back and wonder why it doesn't sound quite like your favorite presenter or DJ on the radio. This is because radio stations apply additional processing to their presenter's voices to give it that rich, warm sound. The two most commonly used effects are Compression and EQ (equalization). Both of these work together to give that classic radio sound. 

Most audio software such as Garageband and Audacity, have these effects built-in. But if your wave editor of choice does not feature these as standard, it is most likely possible to install them as VST plugins. Blockfish is a freeware VST compressor plugin compatible with both Mac and PC. And Pushtec EQ is a freeware EQ plugin.

Compression is basically an automated volume control that when applied to a recording, will turn down parts above a specified threshold by a certain specific amount. The end result is a sound that is smoother in terms of volume and has the perception of being subjectively louder and fuller. Not everybody (especially untrained amateur presenters or hobbyists) is able to speak at a fixed volume for an extended period. Naturally, the voice will vary slightly over time. Setting your compressor's threshold just above the quietest parts of your recording will pull down anything louder to match that level. This smoothes out the recording and gives it more 'body'. The lower you set the compressor's threshold, the ‘fatter’ the sound will be. Be careful of setting it too low however, as over-compression can do more harm than good and will put off your listeners. As a starting point, I would suggest setting your compressor's Ratio to 5:1, your Attack as fast as possible, Release to Auto (if it has that option) and dial in your Threshold until you get a sound you're happy with.

One side-effect of using a lot of compression is that it will tend to emphasize the lower frequencies. This can make the recording sound overly ‘bassy’ and lacking in clarity. To compensate for this, people will often add a bit of top-end sparkle or 'air' back in with EQ. Typically this would be a small boost of a few dB at somewhere around 16kHz. This depends on the person's voice and you will need to play around until you find the ideal setting. Once you're finished you should end up with that rich, warm sound you're after."
88	Guitar Tip	"And now for the Guitar Tip Of The Week:
Take care of your hands. You can finger notes more easily if you keep the nails on your fret hand trimmed short. Leave the nails on your picking hand slightly longer to facilitate plucking the strings. Rough edges on your nails will impair the tone of your playing, so be sure to use a good set of clippers and an emery board to maintain smooth nail tips. Wash your hands prior to playing. Clean hands transmit less dirt and help maintain string life and tone."
89	High School Art History 1	Study the paintings. Can you see how both artists composed their pieces from an elevated vantage point? The viewer seems to be standing above the figures looking down, and the floor seems to tilt upward.
90	High School Art History 2	Artists of the Romantic period thrived on emotion, imagination, and intuition. They were inspired by the idea of freedom. Like their Baroque predecessors, Romantic painters often focused on danger, conflict, and heroic struggle. In the painting you see here…
91	Hosting A Tea Party	When thinking about tea parties, do you find yourself overwhelmed with thoughts of the British gentry, scenes from Alice in Wonderland, Victorian décor, blue haired ladies, and pinky fingers stuck up in the air? If so, you’re right—and wrong.
92	How To Accessorize A Bedroom	The decorating scheme in a bedroom shouldn't bore you to sleep every night. Choose accessories that are attractive as well as functional, but avoid clutter. A decorative box is a great hiding place for a remote control, eyeglasses, tissues and other typical bedside paraphernalia. Place a telephone and a flashlight within reach of the bed. These items can be life savers during an emergency.
93	How to Build a Deck Attached to a House	"Step One - check drainage and grading where the deck will be built and fix any problems. Avoid disturbing the soil where the footings will go because footings need to set in undisturbed soil to prevent settling.

Set the ledger against the house wall or other solid structure and attach with lag screws. This must be done against a flat surface. Instead, use shims to create a flat surface. When setting your ledger you need to consider your decking material height/thickness. If you desire your deck to be level with an adjacent floor, your deck should be directly below the door jam of that room when finished.

Flashing should be installed between any wood and the house (unless it is a stucco house, then no need for flashing). Mark the foundation with string line, then mark the footing and post locations. Cast concrete footings in the ground, then attach the concrete piers on top to hold the posts. (Check building codes for required depth for footings.) Piers can be cast in place or pre-made."
94	How To Build A Law Practice	Frankly, I expect that many, if not most, of the new lawyers who start their own practices today have no choice. They would prefer to get jobs, but can’t for various reasons, including: 1. They are in the 95% of a law school class who are not in the top 5% of the class. 2. They don’t have a rich relative who can pressure a law firm to put a son or daughter on the payroll or risk losing the family’s company as a client to the law firm that hires the son or daughter…

This is a quick how-to-video that will guide you through how to use the ABC Attestation interface. We hope you find this helpful."
99	Hydroboration	One of the features that makes the hydroboration reaction so useful is the regiochemistry that results when an unsymmetrical alkene is hydroborated.  For example, hydroboration-oxidation of 1-methylcyclopentene yields trans-2-methylcyclopentanol. Boron and hydrogen add to the alkene with syn stereochemistry, with boron attaching to the less highly substituted carbon.  During the oxidation step, the boron is replaced by a hydroxyl with the same stereochemistry, resulting in an overall syn non-Markovnikov addition of water.  This stereochemical result is particularly useful since it is complementary to the Markovnikov regiochemistry observed for oxymercuration.
100	Hydrocarbons	First, hydrocarbons, or compounds that could have been converted into hydrocarbons at the intense pressures of the earth’s depths, must have been a common constituent of the primordial materials out of which the earth was formed. Second, in the four and a half billion years since the earth accreted, the primordial hydrocarbons must not subsequently have become dissociated and fully oxidized to carbon dioxide and water by exposure to the significant amounts of oxygen bound in the rocks of the earth’s crust.
101	Instantaneous Displacements, Part Deux	"As you can see in Figure 3-1, a bar is fixed at one and is set into vibration by tapping it from the bottom. Imagine that a strobe light is used to take a series of snapshots of the bar as it vibrates up and down.

At each snapshot the instantaneous displacement of the bar is measured. Instantaneous displacement is the distance between the rest position of the bar (defined as zero displacement) and its position at any particular instant in time.

Positive numbers signify displacements that are above the rest position, while negative numbers signify displacements that are below the rest position. The vibratory pattern that is traced out when the sequence of displacements is graphed is called a sinusoid."
102	Interactive Math Textbook	"In one 24-hour day, Sam took 3 naps for:

1 hour, 2 minutes,
2 hours, 58 minutes, and
1 hour, 11 minutes.
How many hours was Sam awake?

You're right!

Hmmm... try again.

Time's almost up... want a hint?"
103	IRA Annuity	In the next 15 minutes, you will learn the four steps towards a better retirement. An IRA will be a key player in almost any retirement plan. Here are some steps you can take now to make your IRA work harder for you and help secure a more comfortable retirement. The earlier you start contributing to a tax-deferred IRA Annuity, the larger your nest egg can grow. Over time, the combination of tax-deferral and compound interest can be dramatic. Although you can open an IRA Annuity with as little as $50, making the maximum contribution of $2,000 means you will have more money growing tax deferred.

105	John Nash’s Nobel Lecture	"Thank you. I've always believed in numbers and the equations and logics that lead to reason. But after a lifetime of such pursuits, I ask, ""What truly is logic? Who decides reason?"" My quest has taken me through the physical, the metaphysical, the delusional -- and back. And I have made the most important discovery of my career, the most important discovery of my life: it is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logic or reasons can be found. Perhaps it is good to have a beautiful mind, but an even greater gift is to discover a beautiful heart. I'm only here tonight because of you. You are the reason I am. You are all my reasons. Thank you."
106	Lawn Mowers	If you’re considering purchasing a walk-behind mower, there are a number of features to consider beginning with the starting mechanism. Mowers with an electric start crank instantly with a turn of the key or the push of a button. All electric mowers feature this starting system, plus there are now many electric start gas mowers available and they don’t cost much more than manual start mowers. Just keep in mind with electric start mowers you will need to use an plug-in charger between mowings and during the off season to prevent the battery from dying. Manual start mowers have come a long way in both design and starting performance and most new manual start mowers now have start cords located conveniently near the handle bar, and manual priming and choking are a thing of the past. You simply pull the rope and mow.

Sit or lie comfortably. You may even want to invest in a meditation chair.
Close your eyes.
Make no effort to control the breath; simply breathe naturally.
Focus your attention on the breath and on how the body moves with each inhalation and exhalation. Notice the movement of your body as you breathe. Observe your chest, shoulders, rib cage, and belly. Simply focus your attention on your breath without controlling its pace or intensity. If your mind wanders, return your focus back to your breath.
Maintain this meditation practice for two to three minutes to start, and then try it for longer periods."
114	Mental Health Crisis	Dealing with a family member or loved one who suffers from mental illness is a difficult and complicated task. And in most cases, love simply isn’t enough. People with mental disabilities need professional help, especially if they are in the midst of a crisis. Too often, family members think that they can deal with these problems on their own, but they can’t. Truth is, a person experiencing a mental health crisis who is left untreated can pose a serious threat not just to their own safety, but to the safety of everyone around them as well.

This simulation is an evacuation drill (begin fade out?) to prepare for disasters such as fires and earthquakes.
119	Mortgage Shopping	Before you go house shopping, the Connecticut Society of CPAs recommends that you watch this video on mortgage shopping. Understanding the various mortgage options, requirements, rates, and fees will help you determine how much you can afford to spend on a home, and how much you can easily finance. So ... how much can you afford to borrow? The amount of the loan, the type of loan you select, as well as its annual percentage rate, will determine the amount of your monthly payments. Generally, lenders recommend that your monthly mortgage payments do not exceed 25 to 28% of your gross monthly income.

124	Nuclear Energy	Nuclear energy is the energy that is produced by a nuclear reaction. It is often called atomic energy, because in a nuclear reaction, the atoms of certain materials are either split (fission) or joined (fusion). This reaction causes the release of great amounts of energy and radiation. This radiation is very powerful and dangerous to living things. Every element is made up of atoms that have a central core, called the nucleus. The nucleus is made up of protons, which are positive particles, and neutrons, which have no charge. Surrounding this nucleus are negatively charged particles, called electrons, and the atom is held together by weaker electrical forces and very strong nuclear forces.

129	Organic Chemistry	"Organic Chemistry Read

The best method for preparing nonhalogenated cyclopropanes is the Simmon-Smith reaction.  This reaction, first investigated at the Du Pont company, does not involve a free carbene.  Rather, it utilizes a carbenoid---a reagent with carbene-like reactivity.  When diiodomethane is treated with a specially prepared zinc-copper alloy, (iodomethyl) zinc iodide, is formed."
130	Oscillators	An oscillator is a circuit that is capable of a sustained AC output signal obtained by converting input energy. Oscillators can also generate square waves, ramps or pulses for switching, signaling, and control. Simple oscillators produce sinewaves, but another form, the multivibrator, produces square or sawtooth waves. These circuits were developed with vacuum-tubes, but have since been converted to transistor oscillators. Figure 1 is a simple block diagram showing an amplifier and a block representing the many oscillator phase-shift methods.

133	Personal Investing	How would you like to get a jump on big institutional investors? Here’s one area of the market where you can. Spinoffs, or divisions of large companies that have been turned into separate public companies, offer a chance for individuals to buy into stocks on the cheap -- before the big investors do. In the first year or so after a spinoff occurs, the infant companies generally do not pay dividends, so many institutional investors pass them by. Index funds also spurn these shares because many are too small to be included in any of the broad stock market indexes. But those reasons shouldn’t keep you from looking at these stocks, because studies show that they are sterling performers.

135	Phase Conjugate Wave Technology	Phase conjugate wave technology has many intriguing applications. A high-quality optical beam can be transmitted through a turbulent atmosphere and, after generation of its phase conjugate beam, be made to retrace its path exactly. Such beams can be used in the pointing and tracking of optical computing, laser gyroscopes, fiber and satellite communications systems, laser weapons systems, and photolithography. The mirrors that generate phase conjugate beams also make possible novel laser renovators.
136	Philosophy Simplified	"O disciple, knowledge without action is madness and action without knowledge is void. Know that, the person most severely punished on Judgment Day is one who did not benefit by his knowledge; seek refuge in God from knowledge that is not useful. So act according to the knowledge you acquire. 

O disciple, live as long as you want, but you must die. Love whatever you want, but know that you will become separated from it. Act however you want and you will be rewarded for it. 

Know that the knowledge of certain things cannot be taught through study and discussion. This type of knowledge can only be acquired through direct experience, just as the knowledge of sweetness and bitterness cannot be known except by taste."

139	Pitney Bowes U100 Modular Mailing Processor	The U100 Modular Processor is Pitney Bowes’ latest high-end mailing system. The MMP lets customers process mail that is sealed or unsealed, flapped or unflapped. The MMP will open flaps, and seal them as necessary. Unopened flap mail will be opened and sealed as long as the flaps are between 3/4 of an inch and 2-3/4 inches deep. Mail with flaps between 2-3/4 and 4 inches must be loaded with the flaps opened. Any of these types of mail may be loaded mixed with one exception: unopened, non-sealed mail cannot be loaded with sealed mail. If these types of mail are mixed, the MMP will attempt to open and seal both the sealed and unsealed envelopes.
140	Pitney Bowes U100 Modular Mailing Processor 2	This system uses the envelope length information from the idler encoder and flap edge information from the flap array to set a path for the nozzle. The nozzle motor guides the nozzle 1/4 inch inside the flap edge as the pump motor pumps a metered amount of water through the nozzle. As the sealer transport rollers move the mailpiece out of the sealer, the flap is diverted back above the deck surface by a deflector mounted to the registration wall. When the envelope is fed up through the gap between the decks, the ski and transport assemblies pick up the envelope and press the flap against the envelope surface.
141	Portray	"60 second explainer
The challenge facing consumers today is that we get up to 5,000 marketing messages a day. Too often these ads are used to interrupt consumer’s entertainment, instead of adding value to the context the message is served. As a marketer, it’s tougher than ever to break through this clutter. Catching the consumer’s attention and moving them to action is becoming increasingly more difficult. So why not make it easy on yourself? Portray is the perfect marketing vehicle to inspire shoppers to follow a curiosity or passion, and immediately convert it into a purchasing experience. Showcase relevant updates on the latest products, promotions and can’t-miss events while daily shoppers are within close proximity to the point-of-purchase and in the purchasing state of mind. No other media platform can close the gap between an impression and instant gratification like Portray."
142	Psychology Textbook Audition - Major Schools of Thought	"Major Schools of Thought

<1>Structuralism

Structuralism involves breaking down psychological experiences—thoughts, feelings, and behavior—into their most fundamental components and then exploring how these components connect to create more complex systems and phenomena. It posits that consciousness can be categorized in terms of basic elements, just as physical objects can be reduced to smaller parts. Wilhelm Wundt is often considered to have been the founder of this school of thought, and he is said to have been the first to call himself a psychologist; Edward B. Titchener was structuralism’s primary torchbearer. Wundt’s establishment of the first experimental psychology lab, in 1879, led to decades of exploration that focused on defining and categorizing elements of the psychological experience. Structuralists were most interested in further understanding thoughts, emotions, and perception; they did not concern themselves as much with personality or behavior. Structuralism asserts that the main method of identifying fundamental components of psychological phenomena is introspection, an approach by which the structuralists intended to create descriptions of mental processes in the most basic terms. The term introspection, though it sounds like something you do on your day off while lying on the couch and wondering where your life is headed, refers in this case to more a more scientific and structured exploration. A person, often a psychological theorist, would embark on the methodological observation of his or her own inner thought process under carefully controlled experimental conditions and would then report back as objectively as possible. Though empirically oriented, this method eventually fell out of favor as a research technique, given the question of how externally observable an individual’s thoughts can be as well as possible biases and the impossibility of quantifying of any given person’s self-report. For this reason, structuralism also fell out of favor in psychology when psychology’s focus shifted to more outwardly measurable mental processes and actions.

<1>Functionalism

As its name implies, functionalism is concerned with what things do, and with the results that follow, rather than with what things are. It is the yin to the yang of structuralism, and it came into being as a reaction against structuralism. From the functionalist perspective, a psychological state’s meaning emerges not from its components but from its end product. A functionalist would say that any mental state—sadness, ecstasy, guilt, boredom—is definable primarily by how it spurs subsequent action or mental states. In that sense, a functionalist would argue that different emotions that have led to the same reactions or behavior may not be so different after all. Moreover, from the functionalist perspective, that similarity of reactions or behavior is much more important than any differences in the mental states that gave rise to them. Given this focus on the actionable results of mental states, functionalism is more concerned than structuralism is with behavior, since functionalism emphasizes how a person’s mental states will play out in the surrounding world. Functionalism, focusing less on mental processes than on the capabilities of the mind itself, places importance on experimental results that can be applied in practical ways, and so a lot of theorists under the functionalist umbrella have emphasized quantifiable, observable research results. Some of the earliest formal psychology laboratories were established by functionalists. Later functionalists, such as Edward Thorndike, can be viewed as early behaviorists, since they were most interested in the way that an organism responds and adapts to its environment."
143	Puppy 101	Section #3: In the next few minutes, you will learn the basics of crate training your new puppy. When you bring your pup home for the first time, you should already have his crate set up with newspapers or a soft rug or towel. If your new puppy is younger than 10 weeks when you bring him home, we suggest placing an exercise pen around the crate. This will give him the advantage of not being shut up in the crate at an early stage for long periods of time. Usually around the 10-14 weeks stage, they become ready to stay in their crates all day while you are at work and all night while you sleep. You may keep a toy or two in the crate but we don't recommend keeping food or water in the crate, as this will lead to a huge mess.
144	Puppy Fun	"For a great time with your puppy, there’s nothing like a game of fetch. It’s best if you can play it in the park or along the shore, but it can be fantastic fun in the backyard or even the living room, assuming yours isn’t filled with irreplaceable figurines. What’s more, playing active games like fetch teaches a puppy to focus and follow instructions. If your pet has never played before, pique his interest by tossing the fetch toy and demonstrating how to chase after and retrieve it. He’ll master the concept in no time.

Who doesn’t love a game of hide and seek? It’s even more fun with a furry friend. Games like these are great exercise and provide a wonderful outlet for honing your happy hound’s hunting skills. Start the game by having a friend hold your dog while you go and hide. Then, say his name every few seconds until he finds you. He’ll be very excited when he does – young dogs love this game. 

Most of all, enjoy your playtime with your new bundle of fluffy fun."

146	Radiation comes from both natural and artificial sources	"Radiation comes from both natural and artificial sources. Natural sources include radioactive rock and soil formations, and cosmic radiation from outer space. 

Artificial sources include nuclear power plants, nuclear weapons, tobacco smoke, radioisotopes, and rays used in medical diagnosis and treatment.

Humans are constantly exposed to background radiation which emanates from several of these sources. This is generally very small but has a cumulative effect."
147	Ravens	"Students often ask us how to tell the difference between a crow and a raven. Although the two birds are closely related, there are a few ways to tell them apart.
Ravens differ from crows in appearance by their larger bill, tail shape, flight pattern and by their large size. Ravens are as big as Red-tailed Hawks, and crows are about the size of pigeons.
In populated urban areas, ravens are uncommon. If you see a ""really big crow"" in the city, the chances are good that it really is a crow and not a raven.
Common ravens have a well-developed ruff of feathers on the throat, which are called 'hackles.'
While flying, ravens soar more than crows. If you see a ""crow"" soaring for more than a few seconds, take another look - it might be a raven. Common Ravens can do a somersault in flight and even fly upside down. Ravens are also longer necked in flight than crows.
Raven wings are shaped differently than are crow wings, with longer primaries (or finger-like feathers) that have more slotting between them.
Finally, ravens have wedge-shaped tails and crows have fan-shaped tails"
148	Reading Tablature Intelligently	The first step toward developing a big-picture outlook in reading tablature is to recognize chord shapes. This starts with open-position chords, as shown in Example 2. Now, it’s one thing to be able to recognize a chord when it’s all nicely lined up, but guitar music, especially acoustic guitar music, often uses arpeggios and different fingerpicking patterns.

2) On the homepage you'll see the search box at the top of the screen, just to the right of the REI logo. Type either the catalog product name or six-digit item number in the search box. Then just Click on the orange ""GO"" button."
151	Removing A Tile	"Score the tile and hit it with a cold chisel in order to crack the tile.

Since the grout has been removed, you do not need to worry about cracking the rest of the tiles.

Remove the tile and the leftover thin set. You can scrape the old thin set off using a five-in-one tool and a hammer. The area where the old tile was located needs to be leveled so that the new tile will not stick out."
152	Removing Fixtures	Removing old kitchen and bathroom fixtures to make room for new ones is mainly a task of loosening nuts and bolts. Most sinks, lavatories, toilets and bathtubs can be disconnected with such simple tools as a screwdriver and a variety of wrenches, including a basin wrench, used in cramped spaces. Always begin by cutting off the water supply nearest the fixtures. Usually this involves closing valves on the fixture's supply lines. But for old fixtures that have no valves, you may have to shut down the entire house supply.
153	Replacement Windows	"When shopping for replacement windows, look for the NFRC label which provides information on how energy efficient a window is. Consider double-glazed windows. These offer better insulation and help reduce outside noise.

Also look for windows that offer a low ""E-2"" coating and use argon gas between the panes. Features like these will help keep your home cool in the summer and warm in the winter.

If your existing window frames are still in good condition, you may want to consider an insert replacement window. These are designed to fit into an existing window frame and will save you the time and the cost of a complete window tear out. And look for an extruded aluminum clad exterior with a virtually maintenance-free finish."

PART 1 – Deciding if a Pet is Right for You

Slide 4 Narrative

While there are many decisions to make before deciding on a pet, the main one that must be made is deciding if you are ready to make a lifelong commitment.    When I say Lifelong…I’m talking about the life of the animal.  They will need to be cared for, fed, exercised and loved.  While you may have the desire, you must be realistic in what you can offer.   

What kind of relationship do you desire with your pet?   Do you want a social companion, do you want them to be a part of the family, will it be used strictly for protection?     

You also need to know a time commitment you are willing to give your pet.   Is your lifestyle conducive?  Do you travel much or do you participate in work or activities that keep you from being at home most of the time?  Will you have time for training, exercise, and playing?"
155	Retirement Advice	"ONE OF THE MOST important investment decisions you will ever make is not whether to retire but when you chose to do it. Every American looks forward to the day when they can trade the 9-to-5 grind for a little bit of well-deserved rest and relaxation. But the easiest way to erase decades of smart saving — picking the right funds, contributing the right amounts — is to start taking big withdrawals at the wrong time, especially if the stock market is in the midst of a prolonged slump.

By tapping an account during a down period, investors run the risk of eating into years of valuable retirement income that they may never be able to regain. They may have the money today but as the typical American starts to live well into their 80s they may not have that money down the road. This is particularly important now, since there is a lot of uncertainty in the market. Luckily, there are some easy steps you can take, like getting a handle on what financial pros call your investment horizon, to help you insulate yourself from this problem."
156	Revlon	At Revlon, we believe that looking good means feeling good about yourself. And for most women, looking good begins with clear, smooth, glowing skin. How do you get it? That’s what this Color-Stay Make-Up Video is all about. This video teaches you about your skin, and how by performing some basic techniques, you can get and maintain a beautiful and younger complexion. Simply follow the basic steps in this video. Within just one week, you will begin to see positive changes.
157	Roses	Roses prefer a sheltered, sunny spot and well drained soil; but otherwise, these paragons are surprisingly easy going and will succeed in most gardens or backyards. In fact shrub roses will flourish on quite light, even poor soils. It is important to give your roses a really good start. This means some digging. So whether you are planning to plant a single rose or a large bed, it is advisable to double dig so the subsoil is well broken up, especially if drainage is less than perfect.
158	Running Shoes	There is no perfect running shoe, partly because no two feet are alike, even on the same person. Still, top brands can be comfortable, safe, and effective running mates -- if you know what to look for. This video gives you some practical guidelines to help you find shoes that will serve you well in the long run. If in doubt, don’t buy. Shoes should feel just right in the store. Don’t count on improvements after they’re “broken in.” Take your time to buy. Try to shop when business is slow so you won’t feel embarrassed about trying on many pairs of shoes. Buying in haste is a good way to end up with poorly fitting shoes that can cause injuries.
159	Saucony	"Addicted to running? In this video, Saucony's Custom Ride Management, or CMR, will help you ""Define Your Ride.""

161	Search engine optimization	"Basics of search engine optimization

One of the most important aspects of search engine optimization (SEO) is optimizing your page content. ""Optimizing"" simply means putting the keywords you’ve selected into your web pages in the right places, with the right formatting. The ﬁrst thing to understand is that you should only use 1-2 search terms to optimize each page. Once you’ve selected a page to optimize, and the search terms you are going to use, all you have to do is put those words in the right places of the HTML code and you're done.
Where the search terms go:
1. Your page’s title tag
2. Your “keywords” and “description” META tags
3. In the ﬁrst paragraph of body text
4. In the text of any links that point to the page.

 If you need ideas for words that you can use to describe your services, view our list of keywords."
162	Snowboarding	Ask most folks to describe their first day on a snowboard, and what they’re sure to mention is falling down, more frequently--and more emphatically--than they ever imagined possible. Well, though it’s often said that nothing in life comes easy, snow-boarding can, at least once you get past the initial frustration. Without further ado, here are some hard-won tips to help minimize day-one bruises. Forget what you’ve heard about the sport being a breeze for anyone who already skis, surfs, skateboards, or seamlessly slaloms through a plague of Gap-crazed mall rats.
163	Social Security	Whether you’re young or old, male or female, single or with a family – this video is for and about you. That’s because Social Security has programs that affect everybody.

164	Spa Guard Instructional	"Spa maintenance is important - and relatively easy - as long as you know what to do. This guide will help. By following these easy procedures and using Spa Guard products, you can:
Keep your spa water protected from bacteria.
Keep your spa water clear and comfortable.
Enjoy your spa when you are ready.
Even if your spa is equipped with an ozone generator or some form of ion device, you still need to pay attention to the maintenance information provided in this video. Of course every spa is different, so you should consult your spa owner’s manual for equipment operation and maintenance procedures. Always read product labels for detailed information on application and use. And of course, feel free to ask your Spa Guard dealer any questions. Because we want you to have a perfect spa environment whenever you’re ready to explore the fine art of relaxation."
165	Stages of Photosynthesis	"Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. These stages are called the light reactions and the dark reactions. The light reactions take place in the presence of light. The dark reactions do not require direct light, however dark reactions in most plants occur during the day.

Light reactions occur mostly in the thylakoid stacks of the grana. Here, sunlight is converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP (free energy containing molecule) and NADPH (high energy electron carrying molecule). Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and starts a chain of steps that result in the production of ATP, NADPH, and oxygen (through the splitting of water). Oxygen is released through the stomata. Both ATP and NADPH are used in the dark reactions to produce sugar.

Dark reactions occur in the stroma. Carbon dioxide is converted to sugar using ATP and NADPH. This process is known as carbon fixation or the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle has three main stages: carbon fixation, reduction, and regeneration. In carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is combined with a 5-carbon sugar [ribulose1,5-biphosphate (RuBP)] creating a 6-carbon sugar. In the reduction stage, ATP and NADPH produced in the light reaction stage are used to convert the 6-carbon sugar into two molecules of a 3-carbon carbohydrate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is used to make glucose and fructose. These two molecules (glucose and fructose) combine to make sucrose or sugar. In the regeneration stage, some molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are combined with ATP and are converted back into the 5-carbon sugar RuBP. With the cycle complete, RuBP is available to be combined with carbon dioxide to begin the cycle over again."
166	Summer Beauty And Grooming Tips By Linda Pliagas	"With a never-ending list of makeup do’s and don’ts, it’s nice to know that this summer’s look emphasizes a Latina’s natural belleza.
A healthy, sun-tanned glow is the face all trend-setting women will strive for. Fortunately, many Latinas have a genetic advantage and will likely be envied by those in desperate need of sun rays.
There’s no need to layer on the powder to avoid the shine that appears due to heat, making this season’s ""in"" look shimmery and natural. Don’t worry if you’re a little shiny, that’s the style. If you wish to forgo foundation altogether, but want some coverage, then wear a tinted moisturizer.
To complement the freshly-woken-up-face look, eyebrows need to be grown back. Pencil-thin brows are history, says López-Rivera. Today, they are replaced with a thicker, more natural version. They should still be groomed, but not over-plucked. And while we’re saying adiós to thin brows, welcome moist, kissable lips - this season’s hot item.
For Hispanic men, this season’s emphasis is placed on developing and maintaining a proper skin care regimen. Since men aren’t able to camouflage their imperfections with foundation, they need to concentrate on prevention rather than correction. It’s important for men to cleanse their skin with a product  made specifically for the facial area and for their skin type. Exfoliating cleansers increase circulation, giving the face a healthy glow, and remove dead skin cells that can cause breakouts. After the face is cleansed, remove further impurities by soaking a cotton ball with an astringent (toner) and gently massaging it all over the face (an important step most men neglect).
Another common skin mistake men make is neglecting moisturizing. Applying a facial cream or lotion can stall the aging process and make the skin look healthier."

169	Tax Fundamentals	"On this episode, we’re talking about: Deductions

So let’s say you’re single with a job as a lion tamer. You live alone, have no dependents, and your yearly income is eighty eight thousand dollars.

You have two choices when it comes to deductions: You can itemize your deductions, or take the standard deduction. 

The lion food is an example of an itemized deduction. You can claim multiple itemized deductions but there are limits for each tax bracket and rules around each deduction.

The standard deduction is a fixed amount associated with your filing status and tax bracket. If you don’t want to add up all your expenses, the IRS allows you to just take the standard deduction. If your itemized deductions don’t add up to a lot, taking the standard deduction instead can often save you more money on your taxes.

So that’s the skinny of Tax Deductions. Want to learn more, CTA. Thanks for watching Tax Fundamentals."

172	The Northern Lights	Alaskan legend describes the Northern Lights as torches carried by the dead as they move into the next life. A more scientific account says that the world's oldest laser show is the result of solar particles that hurtle through space until they collide with Earth's atmosphere, releasing a burst of radiation that we see as the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis.
173	This Old House	"A leaky kitchen faucet is a minor problem. Yet a steady trickle of water is a waste of both water and money, and eventually it will get on your nerves.

Before starting repairs, your first step is to shut off both hot- and cold-water supply lines under the sink."
174	This Old House 2	Your kitchen sink may be the only thing in the room that works harder than you do. A good-quality sink can last 15 years, but even so it's likely to need replacing before you need a total kitchen overhaul. This month's Homeowner's Video includes step-by-step instructions for replacing a kitchen sink. It's your weekend project, from This Old House.
175	Toy Safety	As you head out to do your holiday shopping, consider this: More than 140,000 children were treated in hospital emergency rooms for toy-related injuries in 1996, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. But don’t worry, there are plenty of toys that are safe--and fun--for your child. The vast array of choices can be overwhelming, but with common sense and a few guidelines, you can have confidence in your purchase. Keeping these guidelines in mind should eliminate some worries, prevent injuries and let everyone enjoy a happy and safe holiday season.
176	Track slider	"Track slider 

The track slider is on top of the control buttons. It shows the progress of playing of the media file. You can drag the track slider left to rewind or right to forward the track being played.
Two timers at the left and right ends of the track slider show the current playing position (left) and the total time (right) of the current track.
Note: When a media file is streamed (live), the position indicator of the track slider does not move because the total duration of the streaming is not known until it finishes."
177	Turbo Encabulator	"Work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a machine that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. 

Such a machine is the Turbo-Encabulator. 

The original machine had a base-plate of prefabulated amulite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing
in such a way that the two spurving bearings were in a direct line with the panametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzel vanes so-fitted to the ambifacient lunar wane shaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-boloid slots in the stator, with every seventh conductor being connected by a nonreversible trem’e pipe to the differential girdlespring on the up-end of the grammes.

Forty-one manestically spaced grouting brushes were arranged to feed into the rotor slipstream a mixture of
high S-value phenylhydrobenzamine and 5% reminative tetryliodohexamine. Both of these liquids have specific pericosities given by the equation P = 2.5 times C times n to the 6th  power, minus 7. In this case n is the diathetical evolute of retrograde temperature phase disposition and C is Cholmondelay's annular grillage coefficient. (Initially, n was measured with the aid of a meta-polar refractive pilfrometer, but until now, nothing has been found to equal the transcendental hopper dado-scope.) 

Undoubtedly, the turbo encabulator has now reached a very high level of technical development. It has been successfully used for operating nofer trunnions. In addition, whenever a farescent skor motion is required, it may be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocating dingle arm to reduce sinusoidal depleneration ."

188	What Does Good eLearning Have In Common With Good Movies?	"You may not have realized it, but  eLearning and movies have many things in common. Both seek to captivate their audience and produce a memorable story, and both can fall flat if not produced correctly.

The Correlation Between Good eLearning and Good Movies

Have you watched a movie lately – a really good one? Were you enthralled? Couldn’t take your eyes off it? Luckily, I did have this experience the other day.  Like any other instructional design nerd, I immediately made the correlation between this marvelous movie experience and eLearning. In fact, I may go so far as to say that movies and eLearning share commonalities in their creation process and overarching theory of entertainment as well.

""Now, hold on there” you may be thinking. ""Movies are purely for entertainment, while eLearning is more serious. It’s … well … learning.  No entertainment there!"" However, what if I changed entertainment to engagement? Would that make a difference? Now we’re talking!"
189	What is material handling accumulation?	"What is accumulation?

Broadly defined, accumulation is the collecting or gathering of packages, product, totes, etc, in preparation for the next step in processing.

Accumulation, in general, performs several vital functions in a material handling system:
•	It can act as buffer, or temporary storage area, regulating the flow of packages moving toward downstream processes.
•	It can regulate the frequency and quantity with which packages are released. For instance, before a conveyor merge or induction to hold groups of packages until it is their turn to enter.
•	It can also be used for any role which requires the product to slow down or stop.
•	Accumulation is essential in high speed production lines to ensure generating units continue to run during the malfunction or downtime of downstream equipment.
•	And due to the inherent real-world unpredictability of what items are needed and when, the accumulation of items while waiting for other operations to receive them is a necessity to any material handling system.
When operating in an accumulative mode, an ECC’s firmware is reliant on input from photo eyes, the PLC, and operations downstream to determine when to start and stop motor driven rollers. A photo eye that is located within a zone is said to be the local photo eye of that zone, or ‘local to the zone’.

And every zone operating in an accumulative mode should have a local photo eye feeding input to the zone’s ECC. Photo eyes communicate whether a zone is empty, or occupied. And keep in mind, if a zone is set to operate in an accumulation mode, but the zone has no local photo eye, it will be logically relegated to operating in transportation mode."

191	Working From Home	"Working in your pajamas. Skipping traffic. Oh yeah. Knowing your lunch is safe from poachers. That’s the blissful reality of working from home.
But as anyone who has done it can tell you, the reality is a lot less dreamy.
