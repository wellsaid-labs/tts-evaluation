"In the initial setup stage, customize your experience by selecting logo and branding options, establishing key dates, and preparing templates and contacts for your new billing experience. Admin access is necessary to access settings and complete the Billing and Payments setup.

By the end of this section, you should have:

Chosen a start date (to exclude work billed elsewhere).

Set your tax rates and tax identification numbers.

Set up your branding.

Customized your invoice template.

Reviewed your invoice email template.

Set up your accounting periods.

And Connected to your chart of accounts.

For firms already utilizing Product to manage client work, it's necessary to set a billing start date. 

This step ensures that only the work you intend to bill through Product is included. It prevents work items not billed in Product, are not marked as ""unbilled"" but are instead completely excluded. Start dates are not editable or changeable once chosen.

Based on the start date you enter, the following will not be shown in the Unbilled screen:

Fixed fee work items with a start date preceding the chosen billing start date will be excluded. For instance, if January 2023 is selected, fixed fee work items that commenced before January 2023 will not be displayed. Items starting after January 2023 will be shown.

For Time and Material work items, only entries or expenses made before the chosen billing start date will be excluded. For example, if January 2023 is selected and the last entry was in December 2022, it will not be displayed. Entries or expenses added from January 2023 onward will be included.

Time entries and expenses on contacts that were added before the billing start date.

Any fixed fee work items and time or expenses added after the start date selected will be included in Unbilled. 

Once your billing start date is set, review your tax rates.

Tax Rates Billing Settings is where the firm can set up Tax Rates, Tax Identification Numbers, and Invoice Templates. The information entered in these sections will then be applied to the Invoices created in Product. 

All accounts will have a set of base tax rates (core rates) applied based on the country of the tenant: 

Navigating to Settings then Billing, the firm can add additional single tax rates for their jurisdiction. This can be done by clicking 'Add Tax Rate'. The firm can then fill in the name and rate and click ‘add’.

Combined tax rates are made up of existing single tax rates. Combined Tax Rates can be used in two ways. 

A combined tax rate will be shown as combined on the invoice. For example in Canada there is HST tax, which is made up of PST + GST. 

As a combined tax rate that will be shown as separate on the invoice. In the US, multiple tax rates will likely need to be applied on an invoice. For example, Marin County in California will have Federal, State, and County taxes. If the firm displays summarized invoices or does Fixed Fee work, there is only one place on the invoice to apply a tax rate. This option allows the firm to set up a tax rate combination so multiple rates can be applied to the invoice. 

What is the Default Tax Rate?

The firm can set one tax rate (single or combined) to be the default tax rate. The default tax rate selected will then be applied by default to Invoices created in Product. 

Let's learn about Updating Tax Rates

Tax rates can be edited by clicking on the row to select a saved rate or click on the ellipses on the relevant row. Tax rates can also be duplicated. 

Note: If a firm updates a tax rate (edits the name or rate), all invoices in a draft state will be affected and use the new name or rate if applied to the invoice.

Tax Identification Numbers 

In many countries, invoices legally need to show a Tax Identification Number (TIN) for each Tax Rate. 

In Billing Settings, firms can associate Single Tax Rates to a TIN. When the Tax Rates are applied to the invoice, any associated TIN will be shown on the invoice (if set to show). 

To set up a Tax Identification Number: 

Click 'Add Tax Identification Number'

Enter the Identifier field which is the name displayed on the Invoice.

Enter the Tax Identification Number 

Select related Tax Rates 

Select if the Tax Identification Number will appear on the invoice. If 'don't show on invoices' is selected, when associated tax rates are applied, a TIN will not be applied on the invoice. 

Note: 

When setting up a Tax Identification Number, the related tax options only show single tax rates. When a combined tax rate is applied on the invoice and includes a single tax rate that is associated with a TIN, that TIN will appear on the invoice. 

If a firm edits the name or changes the rates associated to a Tax Identification Number, all invoices in a draft state will be affected. If a firm deletes a TIN and it was on a draft invoice, it will no longer be visible.

"According to Raw Story's article from Thursday, December 28, 2023, Jolly said that Trump's increasing court dates are to blame for his outbursts, implying that the thought of going to prison is plainly bothering him.
Jolly made a joke on Trump's seemingly insane behavior during his interview with fill-in anchor Charles F. Coleman Jr.
In response, he smiled and said, ""My takeaway is, the old man's afraid of prison."" According to Jolly, Trump has a tendency to act out when he feels trapped; for example, on Christmas Day, he had a tantrum and prayed his adversaries would ""rot in hell.""Additionally, Jolly brought attention to Trump's trend of going against prosecutors who are engaged in cases that could endanger his freedom.
The speaker brought up Trump's criticism of New York Attorney General Letitia James during his Thanksgiving address, who is in charge of investigations into Trump's financial affairs.
Jolly also brought up Trump's assaults on special counsel Jack Smith, highlighting how the ex-president is feeling the heat as his legal battles heat up.
A former Republican lawmaker has speculated that Trump's actions may be a sign that he has lost it. Then Jolly said, ""Maybe he has lost it.""
Many people are talking about Trump's legal issues and his Truth Social agenda.
Some have voiced concerns about the lack of transparency and the possibility of disinformation spreading on Truth Social, a network that Trump developed to compete with popular social media platforms.
Some have hypothesized that Trump's hostile tone on the platform reflects his anxiety over the legal obstacles he must overcome.
The former president is clearly struggling with the prospect of incarceration as the dates of his court appearances approach. As a former Trump supporter, Jolly's comments illuminate worries about the president's mental health and his capacity to handle the increasing legal constraints on him.
People are still very interested in what's happening with Trump's Truth Social platform and his legal issues.
People are watching these developments closely to see how they affect Trump's future political ambitions.
In light of Donald Trump's impending court appearances, former congressman Dave Jolly's comments on MSNBC brought attention to his evident dread of prison.
Jolly's remarks show Trump's erratic behavior and his propensity to react aggressively when he perceives himself being squeezed.
The release of Truth Social and the continuation of legal challenges have added fuel to the fire of concern around Trump's mental health and capacity to handle the fallout from his actions. As reported by Newsweek on Thursday, December 28, 2023, a motion was filed by the team of Special Counsel Jack Smith, which has led to speculation over possible testimony from former Trump attorneys or members of Congress.
The motion may signal that specific individuals are willing to testify in the case, according to legal commentators such as MSNBC's Lisa Rubin and former U.S. attorney for Alabama Joyce Vance.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), renowned legal expert Lisa Rubin claimed that Special Counsel Jack Smith's motion suggests that former Trump attorneys or members of Congress would be willing to testify.
The ongoing judicial processes against the former president are becoming even more intriguing with the addition of this claim.
In a post on her Substack blog, Joyce Vance expressed similar concerns, mirroring Rubin’s discoveries.
The document ""suggests members of Congress, their personal or office staff, or people who received communications from them"" as possible witnesses, according to Vance's interpretation of the documentation.
The legal picture surrounding Trump's case is becoming more complex due to the possibility of testimony from persons closely linked to Congress.
Trump is facing charges that include alleged violations of the law in relation to his efforts to reverse Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.
Trump has entered a not guilty plea to all four federal accusations, firmly asserting his innocence.
March is when the trial is supposed to begin, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan presiding over it.
The case was temporarily halted until the U.S. Supreme Court decides on Trump's claims of presidential immunity, but new developments suggest that there may be a delay.
Because it concerns a former president who is facing federal charges stemming from his behavior after the 2020 election, the upcoming trial is quite significant.
The hearings are further complicated by the potential testimony of members of Trump's inner circle, including former attorneys and lawmakers.
Experts in the field will be keeping a careful eye on these events, trying to predict how they might affect the course and result of the trial.
The start date of the trial is still up in the air due to the ever-changing legal landscape; any postponement could occur until the Supreme Court rules on Trump's allegations.", March 2024,"news-style content
