"“Are you all right?” Leon asked as he shook the nobleman, seeking any kind of response at all since it was clear enough that Gaius wasn’t all right—the nobleman was covered in his own blood, and while Leon’s lightning attack hadn’t been too powerful, relatively speaking, it had still burned some of Gaius’ extremities.

"A noun is any person, place, or thing. For example: Mary, James, Toms River, New Jersey, home, work, desk, job, etc. 

Every sentence in English ""must have"" a noun! 

Nouns can be singular (one) or plural (two or more). Singular nouns need A, ""an,"" or ""the"" before them.  Plural nouns do not need these.  For example: an apple, a book, pencils. 

Some nouns can also be non-count nouns, which means they literally can’t be counted (or it would be very difficult to count them). These nouns generally get the same treatment as singular nouns, except they do not require A or ""an."" Examples of non-count nouns include: hair, water, sand, ice, money, and stress, among many others. In order to make these nouns singular or plural, you must add units of measurement, such as: a strand of hair, a bottle of water, 5 pounds of sand, ice cubes, bags of money, or a mountain of stress.",June 2023,"removed respellings from a, and, and the"

Empathy is when we put ourselves in another person’s shoes to identify with how they are feeling.

"But there is more to allyship than this. True allyship means holding ourselves accountable to advancing the needs of marginalized groups. This means working in partnership and taking our cues from those we seek to act in solidarity with, versus assuming we know what’s best for them. It also means we are in action, rather than on the sidelines. Allyship is using our privilege to share resources and amplify historically suppressed voices. It's taking action, whether or not we get credit or recognition for it. It’s actively listening, educating ourselves, and practicing self-reflection.
