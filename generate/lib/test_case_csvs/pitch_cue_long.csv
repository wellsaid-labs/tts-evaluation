"<pitch value=""-100"">As finding a dinosaur fossil is the wish of many of dinosaur fanatics, Akira thinks that he needs to get his hands on at least one of the dinosaur fossils for real as the world is about to end. After moving through the way of the dinosaur museum, they come in front of the dig site which is surely below a huge cliff. 
Akria thinks of cracking each of them to get his hands on the fossils and wonders if he will be making his name reflect once he starts cracking each one of them. But after trying for a while, they realize that the way of breaking them apart isn’t going as smoothly as they have hoped. While they get busy cracking the rocks, one of the workers sitting next to them instructs Akira to look for the rock’s eye while having a drink. Even though Akira had been feeling quite skeptical about it, the moment he ends up trying the formula, it ends up working as he makes his way to find at least a small fossil of a dinosaur.
But it seems that he didn't do as much as he thought as the man claims that he just found a mud fleck, while the plant fossils carbonize becoming a shiny black material. At the same time, the round brown ones might be shell fossils and if they end up finding something pointed, it would be a dino or gator teeth as most of the dino bones are solid and columnar. Feeling that the guy must have ended half of his hard work, Akira thanks the man for serving so much of information as the man introduces himself as Furuya.
Beatrix guesses that the man must have been a researcher at the museum and instead of caring much about the man’s profession, Akira starts breaking the rocks to find the dino bones, as Shizuka starts helping him with it while making a safe zone before breaking through the rocks.
While Akira continues to have trouble with his rocks, Shizuka ends up discovering some kind of fossilized fern which makes him feel like shit as he isn’t able to find even one of them. Even Beatrix ends up discovering a fossil along with Kencho who gets his hand on a turtle shell which starts to get Akira insane as he thinks that he must be unable to find even a small material from the rocks. While everyone managed to get something from the rocks, Akira is the only one who came to be empty-handed as he continues to hit his rocks the wrong way.
When the whole group starts thinking of spending their time inside the museum, thinking that they will be able to relax for a while, Akira starts to feel bad feeling that he was unable to discover anything on his own, as it would be better for him to die in the hands of zombies instead of living without discovering anything.
As Kencho and the others start talking about enjoying their time in the museum, Akira promises to himself that he will be discovering a whole new species if needed to curb his interest in finding fossils. As his talk gets heard by the mysterious man beside him, he starts to claim that all the dig-site tourists are all the same, remarking him as someone annoying.
On the other hand, the whole group comes inside of the museum to look at the huge skeletons of the dinosaurs. As they begin to fascinate about the huge beast skeletons standing in front of them, Kencho remarks that one surely doesn’t need to be a child to find interest in dinosaurs. As Lambda comes in front of the skeletons, he thinks of having a permission of modifying the body as it might sound like a gorgeous plan to provide Akira with a pleasant prehistoric surprise.
Meanwhile, Akira keeps on knocking down rocks, not losing his hope of finding something great but he keeps on finding nothing at all. The guy beside him understands that he wouldn’t be quitting that easily, reminding himself of his past self when he pursued the same dream as Akira.
He thinks that he would often come down the dig site to stay at the lab before it was about to close. He would always feel like he would find something that will surely change the world, feeling that he would be leaving something extraordinary for the next generation for sure, to make the people see that he once existed in this world</pitch>.",Nov-23,LONG,Long
"<pitch value=""250"">Chapter 13: Legacy Lives On.
In the days following Martin's death, a profound sadness wrapped around the globe. The streets were filled with mourning hearts, but within the sorrow, a powerful realization began to emerge.
People from all walks of life began to speak up about how Martin had touched their lives. Stories poured in about moments of inspiration, acts of kindness, and battles against injustice, all inspired by Martin's vision.
President Lincoln sat in the quiet of the Oval Office, reflecting on Martin's influence. ""This man,"" he thought, ""changed not just a nation, but the world.""
Children in schools read about him, artists painted his portrait, and singers voiced their pain and hope through songs dedicated to him. Statues and monuments were erected in his honor. Every corner of the world seemed to echo with the power of Martin's words and deeds.
While Martin's physical presence was no more, his spirit was everywhere. His dream had ignited a flame in countless hearts, pushing them to continue the work he had started. The world began to see that Martin's impact was immeasurable, transcending borders and generations.
A movement began across the United States. Citizens from every state, young and old, called for a day to remember and celebrate Martin. They wanted a day to reflect on his teachings, his bravery, and his vision for a better world.
In the White House, President Lincoln felt the weight of this call. He too had witnessed Martin's impact firsthand and understood the significance of his legacy. As he sat in his office, he pondered, ""What better way to honor Martin than with a day dedicated to him?""
The proposal for a national holiday reached Congress, and the debates began. Some opposed, but many championed the idea. They believed that Martin's message of love, unity, and justice deserved recognition.
After a time of discussions and votes, the decision was made. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was declared a national holiday. On that day, every year, schools, businesses, and government offices would close in his honor. Families across the country would take a moment to remember the man who had dreamt of a world where character mattered more than color.
Lincoln, watching the nation unite in this decision, felt a deep sense of pride. He realized that even in death, Martin's dream lived on, inspiring generations to come. The decision to recognize Martin as a national hero was more than just a day off; it was a symbol of America's commitment to equality and justice.
The years following Martin's passing saw a surge of young voices rising. They spoke with passion and conviction, carrying forward the torch of justice and equality. In schools, colleges, and community centers, young leaders began to emerge, each sharing a dream, much like Martin's.
From his place of leadership, President Lincoln marveled at this new generation. He would often attend speeches or community events where these young leaders spoke. Each time, he'd find himself moved, reminded of the very first time he'd heard Martin's powerful words.
""I see in these young souls, Martin's dream reborn,"" Lincoln reflected one evening. The fire of change, the thirst for justice, and the spirit of unity were alive in them.
Many of these young leaders cited Martin as their inspiration. They had grown up hearing stories of his courage, studying his speeches, and internalizing his message of hope. For them, Martin was not just a hero of the past but a guiding light for the future.
As the years went on, the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. wasn't just in the pages of history books or on a national holiday. It was alive in the hearts of the young people who were shaping the future. Lincoln realized that true legacies are those that inspire, and Martin's dream was indeed inspiring a new generation</pitch>.",Nov-23,LONG,Long
"<pitch value=""500"">Seizing the opportunity, James roused his sons, briefing them on the upcoming venture and prompting them to prepare their binoculars.
Fortunately, the rangers slowed their pace due to an unexpected sighting: a vast herd of elephants suddenly appeared before their vehicle. Fellow travelers from the convoy had also reconvened at the site in hopes of glimpsing the majestic creatures. Thus, they found themselves parked on the dusty road alongside other vehicles, collectively marveling at the slow procession of these magnificent gray beings. James's sons were now fully alert, their excitement barely contained.
To avoid startling the elephants, a hushed silence enveloped the group. Naturally, provoking an irate charge from one of these powerful creatures was the last thing anyone desired. Instantly, James commenced capturing shots, striving to encapsulate the enchanting family in front of him. Yet, a sudden occurrence swiftly altered the scene.
Initially, concern rippled through the onlookers, presuming the calf on the ground was injured. It swiftly became evident that the situation was quite different. A young elephant calf had flung itself onto the grassy verge beside the road. Eager to discern the reason, many observers stood within their vehicles, employing binoculars for a closer look.
The rangers responded with laughter; the calf's actions were nothing more than a tantrum. Baffled yet amused, James and his family joined in the laughter. It was reminiscent of Lucas’s behavior at times; they found themselves astounded by the similarity between the antics of wild young animals and those of human children.
James's eagerness for a closer view prompted him to document the unfolding spectacle with his camera. With the ranger's aid, he repositioned his equipment nearer to the action before the ranger discreetly withdrew. Concerns lingered about potential conflict when the mother elephant eventually appeared. As a precaution, the vehicles began a gradual retreat, granting the calf more room.
From a distance, they observed the elder members of the herd meandering by, seemingly oblivious to the calf's outburst. Then came the moment of anticipation – the mother's arrival. How would she handle her offspring's tantrum? Would she lift him and pull him along? Would she reprimand him with calls? The ensuing turn of events took everyone by surprise.
The mother elephant approached her calf, gently touched his head, and proceeded on her way. The calf persisted in his vocal protests, dramatically sprawled on the ground. Most onlookers anticipated the mother's imminent return to check on her distressed baby, but astonishingly, she maintained her leisurely pace.
Abruptly, it seemed the calf realized his theatrics were ineffective. He sprung onto all fours and dashed after his mother, abandoning his earlier display. She cast a fleeting glance over her shoulder at her little one racing towards her, then turned her attention forward and continued her measured stride.
She abstained from involvement entirely; akin to a human parent, she had reached her limit with her son's theatrics. So, she executed what any of the grown-ups in the group might have done – she simply walked away, fully aware that sooner or later, the young elephant would grasp that his pursuit of attention was futile.
Fortuitously, James captured the entire incident up close on video. It stood as a once-in-a-lifetime recording. Yet, beyond this, he couldn't resist teasing his son Caden about how he sometimes mirrored the behaviour of the baby elephant. Predictably, his son wasn't particularly impressed by his father's jest, though he did harbour a deep fascination with his very first close encounter with an elephant. In the end, this event highlighted the striking commonalities between animals and humans</pitch>.",Nov-23,LONG,Long
