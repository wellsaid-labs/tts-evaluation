Welcome to WellSaid Labs Inc. (“WellSaid”, “WellSaid Labs Inc.”, “We”, “Us” or “Our”) Terms of Service (the “Terms”). We have created a proprietary method that allows you to create synthetic voices. We love to see what our customers create with this technology. Our service is designed to give you complete ownership of the audio files created and the content you contribute to create the audio files.
Please read these Terms carefully because they govern your use of our website www.wellsaidlabs.com (the “Site”) and the services and products available at or through the website. If you have any questions, contact us at support@wellsaidlabs.com. To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, and our products and services and are collectively called the “Services.” 
By accessing, installing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, it’s simple: do not use the Services.
We reserve the right to modify the Terms and our Services at any time, in our sole discretion. While we are not required to provide notice we will post a notice to changes on our website. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because continuing to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site indicates to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. The date of last revision will be shown at the top of this page. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then please discontinue use of the Services immediately. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice to you, at our sole discretion.
In order to access and use the Services, you will need to create an account (your “Account”). By creating an Account, you become a “User” and represent that you are eighteen (18) years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.
Your Account should be yours – don’t use the Services under the name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person, or use a username that is subject to rights of another person without appropriate authorization. We have a strict “No Robots” policy. You must be a human to use the Services and an automated account is not allowed. This policy also applies beyond Account creation to the general use of the Services. “Robot” (or automatic) activity is not allowed.
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, false or misleading or to reclaim any username that you create through the Services that violates Our Terms. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and Account, and agree to notify Us if your password is lost, stolen, or disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. You are responsible for activities that occur under your Account.
We encourage you to regularly change your password to help ensure your account’s security.
Since we empower our customers to manage and configure their own content for use, we cannot be held responsible for any breach of data, infringement of proprietary information, customer information, content, or other data. Ensuring the security of that data is your responsibility. If you suspect a data breach or suspicious activity please report it to us immediately.
WellSaid offers Services under several different plans to suit your needs. In order to subscribe for an Account, you will need a valid credit card. For more information about how we handle credit card and other personally identifying and sensitive personal information you may provide us, please read our Privacy Policy at https://wellsaidlabs.com/legal?document=privacy_policy.
Accounts will be billed monthly starting on the day you sign up and then every thirty days thereafter. If you upgrade your Account plan, you will be billed immediately upon upgrading and then on that date on every month thereafter. Each bill paid ensures your access to portions of the Services that require payment for the next month. There are no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account. We treat everyone equally, so no exceptions will be made.
Downgrading your Account may cause the loss of Content or features available to you at your current plan. WellSaid is not, and will not be held to be, liable for such loss. If you exceed your Account plan’s limits (e.g. you have created more audio files than allotted), your access may be restricted and you will need to upgrade to the next available plan.
If your billing method expires or changes, and you do not edit or update your billing information or cancel your account, we will send you a single courtesy notice regarding billing information discrepancies. If you fail to provide us with updated billing information more than three (3) days after notice is sent, WellSaid reserves the right to disable and terminate access to your account. You authorize us to continue billing during this notice period, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
Our services allow you to generate audio files with synthetic voices dictating the text you have supplied. The synthetic voices themselves are proprietary of WellSaid Labs however, the Audio Files (in MP3 format) are provided to you for your own or commercial use provided you are in compliance with these terms including payment obligations. For clarity, You retain ownership in the audio files with a non-exclusive limited license to the embedded synthetic voice technology.
