"""
Module to download and process the M-AILABS speech dataset
http://www.m-ailabs.bayern/en/the-mailabs-speech-dataset/.

Most of the data is based on LibriVox and Project Gutenberg. The training data consist of nearly
thousand hours of audio and the text-files in prepared format.

A transcription is provided for each clip. Clips vary in length from 1 to 20 seconds and have a
total length of approximately shown in the list (and in the respective info.txt-files) below.

The texts were published between 1884 and 1964, and are in the public domain. The audio was
recorded by the LibriVox project and is also in the public domain â€“ except for Ukrainian.

This module targets the en_US dataset only. The file to be downloaded is called en_US.tgz.
It contains 102 hours of audio. When extracted, it creates a list of 14 books with directory
structure of the format:

    en_US/by_book/[Author Gender]/[Author Name]/[Book Title]

Within each book directory, there's metadata.csv file and a wavs directory following the
convention of the LJSpeech dataset.

The current implementation uses types for books, genders, authors to allows robust error checking
and flexibility to select data for a specific gender, author, or book.

There are several missing audio files. During processing warnings are given for these files.
