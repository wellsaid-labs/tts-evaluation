    Tacotron 2 Reference:
        As in Tacotron, mel spectrograms are computed through a shorttime Fourier transform (STFT)
        using a 50 ms frame size, 12.5 ms frame hop, and a Hann window function.

        We transform the STFT magnitude to the mel scale using an 80 channel mel filterbank
        spanning 125 Hz to 7.6 kHz, followed by log dynamic range compression. Prior to log
        compression, the filterbank output magnitudes are clipped to a minimum value of 0.01 in
        order to limit dynamic range in the logarithmic domain.

    Tacotron 1 Reference:
        We use log magnitude spectrogram  with Hann windowing, 50 ms frame length, 12.5 ms frame
        shift, and 2048-point Fourier transform. We also found pre-emphasis (0.97) to be helpful.
        We use 24 kHz sampling rate for all experiments.
