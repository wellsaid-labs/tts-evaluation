        "“Yield Computations.”\nThe interest rate will always be stated as a percentage of the par "
        "value. The interest stated on the face of the bond is called the nominal yield. Sometimes "
        "it is referred to as the coupon rate. To compute the annual interest payments in dollars, "
        "multiply this nominal yield by the face amount of the bond (1000 dollars unless stated "
        "otherwise). A bond with a 5% coupon rate pays 50 dollars per year. One with an 8% nominal "
        "yield pays 80 dollars per year. One with a coupon of 13 point 5% pays 135 dollars per "
        "year. Because, on any particular bond, this interest payment is the same every year, it "
        "is referred to as a fixed charge.\n“Test Topic Alert.”\nWhen a question states that a "
        "bond pays interest at a rate of 6% semiannually, it does not mean two payments of 60 "
        "dollars per year. The interest rate is always stated on an annual basis (60 dollars per "
        "year), and it is paid twice per year, or 30 dollars every 6 months.\n“Current Yield "
        "(C.Y.)”\nInvestors always want to know the return on their investment. The most "
        "straightforward way to do that is to place the return on the investment as follows: "
        "Return divided by Investment.\nThe return will always be the annual interest in dollars "
        "(if referring to a stock, the dividend in dollars) divided by the current market price "
        "(the amount of investment required to own the security). This calculation is called "
        "current yield or current return. For example, if the annual dividend is 3 dollars and the "
        "stock’s price is 60 dollars the calculation is 3 divided by 5% equals 60 dollars.\n"
        "Although most bonds are issued with a face, or par, value of 1000 dollars bond prices do "
        "fluctuate in the market. As stated earlier, the interest a bond pays is called its coupon "
        "rate or nominal yield. Look at this example: The D B L tens of 39. DBL is the name of the "
        "issuer, tens means the nominal yield is 10%, and 39 means that the bonds mature in 20 39. "
        "The letter “s” is added because it is easier to say “the tens” than to say “the ten.” "
        "These bonds pay 100 dollars a year (50 dollars semiannually) for each 1000 dollars of "
        "face value. Regardless of what the market price of the bonds may be, the DBL Corporation "
        "has an obligation to pay annual interest of 10% of the 1000 dollars face it borrowed.\nIf "
        "an investor were to buy these bonds for more than 1000 dollars or less than 1,000 dollars "
        "the return on the investment would not be 10%. For example, if these bonds had a current "
        "market value of 800 dollars their current yield would be 12 point 5% (100 dollars divided "
        "by 800 dollars). Similarly, someone paying twelve hundred dollars for the bonds will "
        "receive a current yield of 8 point 3 3 percent (100 dollars divided by twelve hundred "
        "dollars). Please note that the 100 dollars interest received is the same in all cases "
        "regardless of the current market price.\nBond prices and yields move in opposite "
        "directions: as interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. When a bond trades "
        "at a discount, its current yield increases; when it trades at a premium, its current "
        "yield decreases.\n“Discount and Premium.”\nWhen a bond is selling at a price above par "
        "(or face), it is selling at a premium; when it is selling below par, it is selling at a "
        "discount. Two critical statements to remember are:\nIf you pay more, you get less.\nIf "
        "you pay less, you get more.\nLooking at the examples above, an investor buying a bond at "
        "a premium will always receive a rate of return less than the coupon (or nominal) yield "
        "stated on the face of the bond (8 point 3 3 percent is less than 10%). Conversely, any "
        "time an investor purchases a bond at a discount, the return will be more than the rate "
        "stated on the face of the bond (12 point 5% is greater than 10%).\nIn addition to being "
        "the dollar amount on which the annual interest is based, par value is also the dollar "
        "amount that will be returned to the investor at maturity. Therefore, an investor "
        "purchasing a bond at a discount knows that holding the bond until maturity date will "
        "result in a return of the par value, an amount which will be more than what was paid for "
        "the bond.\nthat the par value received will be less than what was paid for the bond. To "
        "accurately reflect this gain or loss that an investor will have upon maturity, there is "
        "another yield to consider the yield to maturity, or true yield.\n\n"

        "“Learning Objective 9 eff.” Recognize the financial requirements to register as an "
        "investment adviser.\nUnder the Investment Advisers Act of 19 40, there are no specific "
        "financial requirements, such as a minimum net worth. However, as we will see, there are "
        "financial disclosures that must be made to clients under certain conditions.\n“Investment "
        "Adviser Financial Requirements.”\nUnder the Uniform Securities Act, the Administrator "
        "may, by rule or order, establish minimum financial requirements for an investment adviser "
        "registered in the state. We will begin with some requirements that apply to both federal "
        "covered and state-registered investment advisers.\n“Substantial Prepayment of Fees.”\n"
        "Both state and federal law offer extra protection to those clients of investment advisers "
        "who have made substantial advance payment of fees for services to be rendered in the "
        "future.\nThe term used is substantial prepayment of fees. In the case of a federal "
        "covered adviser, it is considered substantial if the IA collects prepayments of l twelve "
        "hundred dollars per client, six months or more in advance. Under the USA, it is more than "
        "500 dollars and again, six months or more in advance.\n“Test Topic Alert.”\nUnder the "
        "USA, when an investment adviser accepts prepayments of fees of more than 500 dollars for "
        "a contract period of six months or more, it is known as a substantial prepayment. "
        "However, under the Investment Advisers Act of 19 40, it does not become a substantial "
        "prepayment until it exceeds twelve hundred dollars.\n“Practice Question.”\nWhich of the "
        "following would nas-uh consider to be a substantial prepayment of fees?\n“A.” 500 dollars "
        "covering the next six months\n“B.” 800 dollars covering the entire contract year\n“C.” "
        "800 dollars covering the next calendar quarter\n“D.” 5,000 dollars covering the next month"
        "\n“The answer is bee.” nas-uh (state law) defines a substantial prepayment of fees to be "
        "more than 500 dollars six or more months in advance. While 800 dollars and 5,000 dollars "
        "are certainly more than 500 dollars they cover a shorter period than six months.\n"
        "“Disclosure of Financial Impairment.”\nAny investment adviser that has discretionary "
        "authority or custody of client funds or securities, or requires or solicits substantial "
        "prepayment of fees, must disclose any financial condition that is reasonably likely to "
        "impair its ability to meet contractual commitments to its clients. As an example, the "
        "S.E.C. has indicated that disclosure may be required of any arbitration award "
        "“sufficiently large that payment of it would create such a financial condition.”\nHere is "
        "the way it is stated in Form A.D.V. Part 2:\nIf you have discretionary authority or "
        "custody of client funds or securities, or you require or solicit prepayment of more than "
        "twelve hundred dollars in fees per client, six months or more in advance, you must "
        "disclose any financial condition that is reasonably likely to impair your ability to meet "
        "contractual commitments to clients.\n“Test Topic Alert.”\nThe Administrator may require "
        "an adviser who has custody of client funds or securities or has discretion over a "
        "client’s account to post a surety bond or maintain a minimum net worth. The requirement "
        "is higher for custody than for discretion. Typically, the net worth required of "
        "investment advisers with discretionary authority is 10,000 dollars and that for those "
        "taking custody, whether or not they are exercising discretion, is 35,000 dollars. If the "
        "adviser is using a surety bond instead, the requirement in either case is 35,000 dollars."
        "\nAn adviser who does not exercise discretion and does not maintain custody but does "
        "accept prepayment of fees of more than 500 dollars six or more months in advance, must "
        "maintain a positive net worth at all times.\n“Definition:” surety bond. A surety bond is "
        "usually issued by an insurance company (the surety) who guarantees payment of a specified "

        "some couples are brought together by the most unlikely of circumstances. Whatever their "
        "place of origin, there is nothing more magical than the Disney couples who, despite all "
        "odds, demonstrate that true love exists and that happiness is just around the corner at "

        "We turned our backs on someone to express displeasure, anger, or disappointment, even if "
        "it wasn't someone in our own group. A narcissist, on the other hand, may exhibit similar "
        "behavior but with entirely opposite goals in mind. The silent treatment is a manipulative "
        "technique used to devalue the target's feelings and self-worth. Those who struggle with "
        "low self-esteem shouldn't have to go through life alone. You have zero worth without "
        "them. They will randomly stop talking to you, and you will have no choice except to "
        "grovel and apologize for everything.\n\nFor the fifth point, they claimed they were "
        "clueless. It's like putting your faith in a bad egg to trust a narcissist. Narcissists "
        "constantly put themselves first, even when things are at their worst.\n\nThe trouble is "
        "that they won't admit they were wrong and are always ready with an excuse. They could act "
        "carefree and cheerful to mask their true evil aim. You'll hear people say they weren't "
        "awful people, just naive or innocent."
