# Third Party

This Python package contains third party code that has been copied from online.

## Motivation

There are two primary use cases for this package:

- This is intended to be used when there is no convenient method for installing some code.
- This is intended to be used when there is an external library we'd like to use but it has a
  small bug. This allows us to copy paste the code and to make small changes to it.
